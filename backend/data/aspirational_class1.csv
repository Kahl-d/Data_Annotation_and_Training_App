another reason why i am here is because in the future i want to get into the medical field to become a pediatrician and also work in a lab.
by taking this class it will allow me to get to where i want to be in the future .
i am here to discover the joy of life.
"if its about the class i am here because i have to be,not because i want to be."
i am here to further my education in science.
i want to learn about physics because it is an important factor in my major and in life.

i still dont know what i want to be doing as a career.
i have been doing research however due to covid i havent been able to do any internship to figure out what i want to be doing and discover what i like.
i really do hope these whole covid things is over so i can do internship and decided what i want to for my life
"i want to become a surgeon and i still think that physics is important because it helps people get an understanding of how much force to use and at what angle to use tools, such as how one should angle a blade or saw and how much pressure to use."
