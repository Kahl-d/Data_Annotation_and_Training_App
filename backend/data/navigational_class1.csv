being in this instituion will pave a way for me to become a professional.
learn and apply my skills to progress towards my career goal.
i am in this class because i want to pass physics and getting an a is part of that journey.
also the reason why i am here in san francisco is to experience new things and figure myself out.
"to give you a better example, when in conversation with people and i feel as if i dont know what to say, i know i always have biology to talk about and take me back to my safe zone."
"as for why i am here in san francisco, i moved away to isolate myself from any distractions that would cause me to not reach my highest potential."
"also i'm trying to transfer next semester so i'm trying to get all my classes together, make sure i have enough credits to get in."
"although i am not a physics major, i need this class and physics 2 in order to get my undergraduate degree."
"not in the literal sense of ""why am in this class."" the answer to that is simple, if i'm in sci then i'll probably get a good grade in physics and a good grade in physics translates to a good gpa, and that will matter when i want to go to med school."
"so far, ive been learning better and have gotten a better grasp on how to solve problems and ive learned through explanation and by teaching other people myself."
"i also need physics to get into the medical school i want to get into, but i really enjoy physics and the challenging problems it brings."
i am also here to get my general education done.
the professors for the sci courses are usually good resources to help find programs as well or to even make the time to stay longer to help you with a problem.
i knew i had to join this because it was my first time ever taking physics unlike many i never took physics in high school.
"in high school i had only taken chemistry and biology, however due to my major, biology, i knew i needed to take all the sciences including physics."
"as a second year, i can not imagine myself being at no other college and feeling very comfortable like i do here to get to my career path in the medical field."
"since physics 111 class is one of the requirements to graduate in my major, kinesiology, there is no option to avoid the class."
"i want to pursue medicine, but i know i have a disadvantage being at a csu, so my plan afterward is to transfer to a uc. my ideal goal is to be a medical examiner forensic pathologist."
"learning to self sufficient, and doing things on my own has helped me get to where i am today."
"speaking specifically about sci111, i am here to be able to understand the material that is being given to me, and to feel more confident in this subject, especially because this is my first time seeing physics."
"i'm here in physics 111112 because i have to take it for my major, and i'm here in sci because my physics class is pretty rough."
i am taking sci 111 because it is a lower division requirement for my major.
im here taking a sci class for physics because i have never taken a physics class.
"physics is a course that i need to take for my major and although i want to say that i will miss physics, the truth is i wont however, i know that in the long run having had the opportunity to gain knowledge of physics will help me in my future academic career."
i am in this sci class to get support for my phys 111 course.
i am here hopefully to gain extra practice to make me more confident in my work and to prepare me for exams.
"i originally enrolled into this class because i had no prerequisite completed to enroll in psychics 111, so i did the aleks, but my professor recommended me to take this course for extra assistance."
the reason i am enrolled in psychics 111 was because i intend to attend medical college after attaining my bachelors degree and they have made psychics a requirement.
"well, in order for me to achieve the above mentioned goal, i must first get through these science and mathematics classes."
i am currently a prechemistry major but i am trying to change my major to biochemistry and the physics 111 class is a requirement for biochemistry so i really cannot fail the class that way i can make sure that i am able to change my major.
i am here because i need to take physics for the mcat and for part of my major.
i don't mind being here because i am very interested to see where physics will take me.
"i think it is important because if you think about it everything involves physics, even medical."
plus while taking physics it isn't bad i actually enjoy the class i learned so much and understood most of it.
"i am here to learn physics to guide me to where i need to be to get me to point a and b, i am so grateful to be able to part of this class and learn so much and the many different properties of how the world works around us."
to be able to get a grander understanding of how i apply to physics every day and going through the struggle that past doctors had to face.
the reason i am in this sci course is to support and solidify my knowledge in physics so that i can have a full understanding of the material going into a test.
i need to complete one year of physics in order to meet the requirements for medical school.
"taking this course is a first step to understanding the intricacies of the world we live in, which will help me grow as an individual."
"i also want a job that i love, and this is a first step in that particular direction."
ive heard from past students that this class was very difficult and would need extra practice in order for me to achieve my goal of getting an a. i also here because i want to have a grasp on the thing i am learning in class.
i want to be a docter and in order for me to achieve that i have to do well in all my classes including this one.
"the first one is that it is required by my major, zoology, to go through physics one and two."
i am taking this class because it is part of my major requirement.
"now for the question of why im here, if you want a clear and concise answer, its most likely due to the fact that its a part of the ge requirement for the school and if i dont complete it, then i wont be able to graduate with a bachelors degree in biology."
"i am in physics 112 because i need it for my major, environmental science."
i need phys 111 because i am a biochemistry major so i need all the science courses that i need to take to get my degree.
"beside getting the credit and meeting the ge requirement, i have the interest in it.to be more detail, last semester, i have finished the general physics class and with a decent performance but what i learned just are some theoretical knowledge."
"i am taking physics as a freshman because coming from out of state, college is quite expensive, so i want to get my ge classes out of the way as quickly as possible so i can eventually graduate as quickly as possible."
"i am enrolled in physics lab 112 to fulfill the academic curriculum expected by my major, kinesiology."
the most reason why that i am taking this course is because of major obviously and also beside that i really enjoy the physics course and mostly the lab.
"also another reason that i am here in this course is my major used to be math and physic when i was in my country and i did really good at them but as i moved here i change my major to biology to become optometric.after i done with my career my job should be related to math, physics,and biology."
i wanted to study science and physics was part of my requirements so that specifically why i am in this class.
i plan on having a career in the medical field and the classes i am taking as of now are my first steps to getting there.
i am here because it is a requirement for me to take physics 111112 for my biology major but i am also still quite interested in physics.
im in this physics lab class because its a requirement for my zoology concentration in biology that i am working towards.
"the reason i am here, taking this physics lab and lecture is because i am a biology major, and it is one of the classes needed for me to take in order to move up to taking higher classes."
"if i'm asked why i'm taking this course, my answer is to cover a major requirement."
"since middle school, i've been so centered at persuing a career as a veterinarian, but my mind has been drifting towards the marine world."
i am currently a junior at san francisco state and i am taking this course to fulfill my prerequisites to apply for medical school.
"i am taking physics along with the lab for a few reasons; i am interested in the subject of physics, it is a challenging course that looks good on my transcript, and it is part of my curricular for the school i am transferring to."
i want to be a veterinarian since i was little and it seems to be the only thing i want to do.
"i dont need a car to get around the city because of the bus, and bart, and, there are so many fun areas."
i feel like i am able to succeed as a biology major in this school.
i am also in san francisco state because the tuition is not too expensive.
"i want to be able to get everything finished in four years, so i have been getting all my upper division and general ed."
i am here in this physics lab because it's a requirement for my major.
physics 1 and physics 2 are requirements to get into ucsfs physical therapy program so im not going to let my fear of math stand in the way of my goals.
"i'm here because it's a requirement for my major which is biology physiology, i dont think i would take this course just for fun."
i am here to pass physics so that i can move on with my major and graduate faster.
"aside from it being a part of my major, i am also curious to know how a subject such as physics relates to my concentration of study, and what aspects of this course is necessary for me to know that will help me in my career."
today i am in my physics class because it is part of a series of science classes i have to take for my major.
"so, i suppose i'm here because i have to take this course in order to graduate."
"why am i here?i'm here because i need this class to graduate, but to zoom out, i'm in school to succeed."
"in addition, phys111 is a course that i have to take in order to take other classes in my major."
"i am here because it is a requirement for my major, which is prebiology and most importantly for medical school."
"well, i think the obviously answer and probably the one that comes up the most is that this class is required for my major."
"""why am i here?""i am taking physics 112 as a major requirement and a prerequisite for later in my college education."
"furthermore, taking this class will help me clear prerequisite for high education as medical school as their is certain prerequisites that have to be cleared before applying or your chances will be dimmed."
"dreams require steps and hurdles like taking physics classes towards a degree, towards eventually (hopefully, maybe) a doctorate."
"my end goal is to be a n obgyn. i counted not fit this into my two year journey at the community college i was in, so i had to complete it after i transferred."
there are certain classes i need to take in order to move forward.
i need to complete one year of physics in order to meet the requirements for medical school.
"in terms of taking a physics lab, it is because it counts towards my major which is biology in concentration with physiology."
"however, i am here because i have goals and i want to pursue a career in the medical field hopefully leading my way to becoming a neonatal doctor."
i am in this physics lab because i need it for my major.
i am here in this class to fulfill the requirements of ucsfs physical therapy school.
im here because i need this class is a prerequisite for my major.
i am here in this class because it is a requirement for me to move on to my other major courses.
"im not too sure if medicine is what i want to pursue, but if it is then i have to know physics for the mcat. if that is the case then i need this class to better prepare me for the physics portion of the mcat. i am a biology major so this is the last physics course i would need for the remainder of my undergrad."
i am taking physics 121 because it is a requirement for going into graduate school for physical therapy.
i am in physics 2 because i need it for my major.
i am here because i need to take 2 semesters of physics with lab as a requirements for the grad program i want to get into.
"i am here because honestly, i have to take this class as a prerequisite for my major, which is general biology."
"what's more, my dream is to become a veterinarian, but in china, there is only limited program that focus on veterinarian science.i transferred from university of california, santa barbara because san francisco is the city i want to stay for the rest of my life and i love everything about sf state.i am here because physics 122 is one of my major lower division class."
"i have an obvious interest in studying how the universe operates, and very little of that has to do with life sciences from what has been demonstrated to me so far. it would seem that life is the exception, and that the physical laws are somehow connected to how life operates. gravity, thermodynamics, mass, acceleration, velocity, light, magnetic and electric forces are involved in every facet of reality. therefore, studying these subjects is required if youre trying to study the properties of the reality that we all share. life only seems to be a property of these subjects combined, which is the end result rather than the process. of course one could say this is a post hoc observation, but i would argue that these are evidences for how life occurred since it would appear that they're a mandatory part of the life existing. on an academic note, i have to take this class in order to finish my degree path and im uncertain whether or not i would if it wasnt required. i think in order to gain a competitive edge and to show initiative that i would, but that is just a guess. physics without calculus isnt that hard, and i feel for the physics majors who must do all of this with calculus since im finishing calculus 2."
"however, off the top of my head after hearing this question, i instantly think about how i am here because it was a class that i needed to take as part of my major."
i am here because this class is one of many classes i need to take to complete a bachelor's degree in biology.
i know that i still have years until i finish my life academically but i know that i want to do everything to help my community.
"why am i here? the reason i am here is because i need this class in order to fulfill my lower division unit requirement for my major, zoology."
i am here also because physics is one of the subjects i have to take as someone who is majoring in biochemistry.
"im here because im trying to major in the stem field, specifically i want to enroll in a phd program after graduating with a b.s in cell and molecular biology."
in being in this lab it serves as the first step of many.
this class is prerequisites for those classes and i hope that physics helps me excel in those classes.
why i am here i am currently taking this course because my major requires me to.
i am here taking this class because i am a biology major and need to take this course to graduate.
i am here because i need to take this class in order to move on further into my major of computer science.
i am here in this class because i had to enroll in it but also to actually learn the material.
i am here because i am required to take this class for my major.
"i am here because i am a biophysio major, and this is a requirement for medical school. i have never taken a physics class before but truthfully i thought by taking this class in place of the other physics series i would able to get another requirement out of the way without spending as much money. however, i am unsure if i want to continue down the path of preparing for medical school and may decide to do something else with my major. maybe through taking this class i will develop a stronger interest in physics and want to discover different interesting aspects about it. if i decide to change my major, which may not be the smartest idea because i am currently a third year and that will set me back a lot for graduating on time, i would change it to some sort of engineering major because of my father being in the engineering field, sparking my interest toward it. i hope through this class i am able to meet more people to study for the quizzes in this lab as well as those in lecture and create a large study group."
this class is mandatory for my major and is also a prerequisite for other classes that i have to take for my major.
i'm taking physics 220 as part of my prerequisite for my computer science classes.
i am here to fulfill my prerequisite for my major but also to get a better understanding of physics.
well the first reason i am here is because this class is a requirement for my major.
"i find that amazing; in order to work on games where they model real life physics, i must know how real life physics works."
"i enjoy learning it, i want to be better, and im here to take a step further into making it my career."
i am currently trying to finish my civil engineering degree as i live at my mothers house and work a part time job at ucsf. i hope to finish up within the next 23 years as i have to complete 130 units compared to 120 units for any other degree.
why am i herei am taking this class because it is one of the prerequisites for my computer science major.
"the first major reason on why i am in this class is it is required lower division course for civil engineers, and with this course i can't graduate so.."
taking physics if a requirement by the school for my major and that is why im in this class.
the main actual reason that i am here is because it is a major requirement.
the lab is a requirement but it will still be interesting to see the ideas in motion.
"i am taking physics to not only fulfill a requirement for my degree, but i am also wanting to learn more about how things work and move."
this is a part of my set course of classes i need to take to get a piece of paper that says i learned a bunch of stuff i most likely will never use.
"but im here in this class because it is required for my major, which is mechanical engineering."
hello everyone!i'm not only taking this course to fulfill my major requirements but also to understand a little bit of the basic science around us.
the reason why i'm taking physics because it's required for my major degree.
"overall, physics, math, and any other science are a big major and impact on the degree that i'm aiming for along with helping me learn all the materials needed for my future careers and what i want to be when i apply for jobs."
"i took this class because of the requirement for my engineering major, but obviously because of how important this is to the subject matter."
i am also hoping to go through at least onehundred credits before i think about making any adjustments to my career goals or school.
"of course i am here because it is required by my major, but i think that this class is cool."
im currently a second year(sophomore) and this is my first year living on campus so just knowing the location of where i live is amazing too and im so excited to get the experience.
"i am here because of course, its a requirement to take phys 220 to graduate with a civil engineering degree, but the reason i'm taking this class is that it's a requirement for a civil engineering course along with the next 2 following phys courses after this one."
the only reason why im in college is so i can increase the chance of acquiring a job in the future that i can enjoy doing.
as for why im in physics is because of my road map and im just genuinely curious about how physics affect our everyday lives.
"i am here in class because it requires for my degree and prerequisite; i am also here because ive wanted to be surrounded with the diverse group of people, to collaborate, have fun while studying."
"""why am i here?""first of all, let's start with this, i am here because i love physics and also because its a prerequisite for my major biology."
"i'm here because it is required for my major to take this class, and also take the next class phys 230 as well."
"regardless of the reason i am here, the important thing is that i am going to try my best to get the most out of this class instead of just passing it because its a graduation requirement."
i'm here because this class is necessary for my major.
why am i here im here because im an engineering major and i had to take this class.
"so i guess im really here because i have an interest in mechanical engineering and this class, or more specifically this laboratory, is preparing me to understand all the necessary math and physics that go into being an engineer."
im here partly because it is required of my major.
i took phys 222 because i amrequired to take it along with phys 220 as it fulfills my lab credit for my computer science major.
physics is one of the required courses to be complete to graduate from the university.
i am taking physics because it is required for my major.
i am here in this class to fulfill my requirements for my bachelor degree in computer science.
"firstly, i am here in the class to meet the requirements to obtain my bachelors degree from san francisco state university."
"although physics is a requirement for my major, i love science and always have as a child growing up."
the reason why i am here is because it is a prerequisite course for my major which is computer science.
"at first, it is a requirement of ge class and my major requirement."
i am here in this class because it is a requirement for my degree and it it also going to help me during my physics class during the year.
"i am a transfer student and this is my first semeter at sfsu. of course, i'm here because this is a class on the request list of my degree."
i hope to pass this lab along with the physics 220 to be one step closer on graduating and working in the career i envision myself doing.
i am a computer engineer and i need this class as a requirement but i also hope to get more out of this class than just pass it.
i am in this class because it is required for my major of mechanical engineering.
though taking honors physics in high school i believe that learning physics in an higher level education environment will boost my knowledge about physics as a whole.
it would be especially easier to learn about physics now and apply to my future coursesi am also here because it is one of the required courses that i must take in my academic pathway to graduate with my engineering degree here in sfsu.
i am here to complete my courses in order to move on in achieving my goal of obtaining my engineering degree.
"this class just happens to be one of the classes i need to take to learn those things, as well as move on to more complicated material in the future."
"to be honest, im here only because my major requires me to pass this class."
"i am here to learn about physics that are related to my major, which would be able to help me after my educations."
i am also here because as a part of my major i need to take these courses as they are required.
if i am going to be completely honest im here to fulfill my requirements in order to graduate.
"even though physics is only a prerequisite to my computer science classes, i do feel like physics is an important concept to learn in order to know how our world works, and because of this it is important for me to take this class, as well as my others, seriously."
"i am taking this class not only because it is a requirement for my lecture physics class, but i feel like i can take something out of this class as well."
i am a computer engineering major that wants to get my degree and have to take this class to fulfill my requirements.
college is not only a way for me to advance my knowledge in many different areas but also to help me enter a field of work to hopefully find a long career in.
i am here because this lab is a requirement for my major in computer science here at san francisco state university.
"""why am i here?"" the obvious reason why am i here is because this class is required to take for my physics class 230."
"im in this class mostly is because i need to take it as a sideclass for my physics calculus ii 230, and i believe most people in the class are whether majoring in computer science or mechanical engineering."
i am here in this electricity and magnetism class and lab because it is part of my graduation requirements.
"a degree will make me advance towards what i need to be, and studying is just a medium."
i am here because it is a class that is required for my major.
"i am here taking physics 230 because my experiences in physics 220 last semester were satisfactory and i find some interest in the subject, even if said interest isn't too much."
"so i guess im taking the class because its interesting, gets me closer to my end goal of getting a cs degree."
"when talking about why i am here in general, then its because i choose the path to continue school and go to a four year college because i think if i work hard during school its going to pay off after graduating and getting a well paying job that i like."
i am here simply because my major requires it.
im here to retake the course.
"its my major course for my major, so i need to pass the class."
"i see this class as a stepping stone to build a bright future for me, my parents, and my future family."
i am here because it is a prerequisite for major classes that i have to take.
the reason im here taking physics 232 is because its a prerequisite for to get my degree in civil engineering.
i am here because it is required of me in order to get a degree as an engineer.
i am in this class because it is required to have a laboratory for physics class which is also required for my major civil engineering.
to take a mandatory course the university told me to in order to obtain a degree for my major.
"first of all, im in phys 232 class because this is the requirement of my phys 230 class."
im here in this class because mostly importantly i need to class for my major and i need to class because it is a prerequisite for my other classes.
im here because i need to take this class as a prerequisite for the future courses i am obligated to take for my major.
so to encapsulate everything i have just stated i am taking this physics 2 course in order to fulfill existing prerequisites for future classes that i need to take for my major
"i am here because this class, phys 230 232, is a required course for me in order to take some courses and graduate from my major."
"although there may be some courses in my curriculum that do not relate directly to my focus of study, they are prerequisites to the classes that will have more of a direct impact to my field of study."
i am here because it is a prerequisite for my major courses.
i am taking the physics 232 lab because i need to take this class to pass physics 232 which is a prerequisite for my major.
i am here because i need it to move on to my other classes and hopefully in the long run become a successful engineer.
it has some fundamental concepts that will further help me understand my other major courses.
i moved to sf state 7 months ago and i blindly follow the courses that are prerequisites for my majors i.e. bachelor of computer science.
"i know why i am here in phys 230 class, it is a prerequisite for my majors but i dont really know why i enrolled so late and messed up my semester."
i'm just trying to finish this degrees and this is the last science related course i'll ever have to take before i'm free.
"even though i am not a huge fan of physics, i have to take it regardless."
also it is required for my major to take this course and i find it interesting even if it has little to no impact on my major.
the simplest answer is that i'm in this class because physics is a requirement for cs. but i just had an interesting conversation with a classmate about why its a requirement.
"i am in this lab because i'm an engineering major and i need this class to graduate, however, i don't want to be here."
i am taking these classes not only because they're prerequisites for me to move on to my computer science related classes but because they are challenging for my current mindset.
the knowledge i gain from my college experience will hopefully help me in my future endeavors when i enter the workforce.
i am here in this astronomy lab to satisfy a ge requirement through sf state.
i am here at sfsu to gain a higher education so i am able to get the best possible opportunities i can be my best in the journalism field.
the main reason i chose this class is because it is a ge requirement.
"but i also chose this out of other lab classes because ever since i have worked in a preschool, i have been interested in learning more about astronomy to share my knowledge one day with my students."
i am taking this class because i needed to take a lab for my credits.
i am in astronomy 116 because it fulfills my general education lab requirement.
i am here because in order to graduate it is required for students to take a class that consists of a lab and a lecture.
"pertaining to why i'm in this class, it's a g.e. that isn't super stem based but still fills a lab requirement."
im here at san francisco state university to further my education and major in finance.
"as a business major, i needed to complete a lab for my major."
"one of the reasons that i am in this class is the obvious, because it is a lower division requirement of sfsu. however, as a lab is required, i had the choice of choosing between an astronomy lab or a biology lab, as i took both classes last year."
the reason i am here is because i wanted to fulfill my ge and this class sounded interesting i guess.
"currently i am taking this astronomy 116 lab for the lab credit to fulfill my general education requirements, i found my astronomy 116 lecture to be more engaging then my biology course."
i am here because it is a requirement for lower division ge. i like astronomy but mostly just learning it not in a lab though.
i'm here in san francisco mostly because it's the furthest away from hole but more importantly there is a great ethnic studies program and an amazing moot team.
i am here for the credits that i need in order to graduate.

i am here so that i can enhance my education and earn a bachelors degree so that i can get a job that makes a good salary and that i get to do something exciting and interesting.
the basic question i can tell you is that this class fulfills my ge requirements and so i have to take this class.
im here taking astronomy because i have a love for space and i am able to take it while fulfilling my general education.
i knew i needed to fulfill my ge for science and out of all the ones offered astronomy seemed to interest me the most.

the reason i am taking astro is because i need the credit for my major to achieve the ge requirements.
"im here to technically satisfy my lab points for graduation but its also a subject i like, which is a bonus when it comes to taking any course."
because i need to take this lab i order to finish up all of my ges as soon as possible.
all i want is to pass the class so that i can get the ge requirement out of the way and continue on with my graduation progress.
i am here because i want to fulfill all of my ge requirements.
"first of all, i am attending to this class to get credit for ge so that i can graduate sfsu for this semester."

i want to try to get into veterinary school that is why i am in ochem. my major is undeclared in bio but really want to concentrate in marine bio so i technically dont need this class to graduate but its recommended for vet schools.
im currently lost as to how it is that i want to make my print in this world currently out of bio chemistry major not sure if i want to do research or medicine or neither ill just go with the flow.
"i want to be in the medical field, but before i do that, i need to finish here (sf state)."
i am here to get extra help in passing the course and the requirements i need to get into optometry school or pa school.
"since i am a biochemistry major, i know i will probably see those topics later in future classes so if i dont understand the basics now."
im taking this sci 115 class to ensure that i do well and get help when i need it
"im here because i want to further my education so that i can become a physician assistant .to become a physician assistant, i will be doing more schooling after sfsu ."
"im taking this class because all my teachers suggested it for an easy a, and to get extra help with chem."
"chem 115 is a requirement for me because i am a biology major, and hope to pass a b or higher, so i figured this class could help me reach that goal."
i am enrolled in chem115 because it is a major requirement needed to get into chem215.
im here in this class because i want to make sure im following along and not falling behind in chem.
"last semester i did chem without the help of a sci course or office hours, but as things get harder the thought of not being able to do something increases, thats why im in this course."
i came to school to learn different ideas and skills that could help me with the next step of my life.
i joined the sci course because i know that its going to help me do better in classes.
even though school is a long process i know in the end it will be worth it.
"if it is in the context of being in this physics lab, then i am here to complete a ge requirement."
"i'm here in this class because its a ge requirement, and i wanted to get it out of the way this semester, im taking this class in combination with the conceptual physics class, and in both i feel as though i'm not challenged enough during those lectures and labs."
"i am here to learn the basics of physics through experiments, also to graduate as the first one in my family from a college university."
this should help me in the future because it is for my major requirement for kinesiology.
i am also enrolled in the physics lecture.
"this class will prepare me for upper division classes, even though its my last physics class, it should come in handy in everyday problem solving."
"i am in in this physics lab, mainly because it is a requirement for my major which is kinesiology."
"to begin with, i am in this class because i need it as a requirement."
"i'm in this particular class right now because i need the credit towards my degree, and because it was mediatory in order for me to stay enrolled in the physics class at the time i wanted."
i switched majors after 2 years and am currently trying to catch up.
i am now a mechanical engineering major since i feel like i would have more fun in that field and it could provide me a lot of opportunities.
"right now i am slightly considering switching to electrical engineering because it was highly recommended by someone i know, but i feel pretty set on staying on the civil side."
i am here to fulfill my mechanical engineering degree requirements.
i want to have a good understanding of physics and other sciences so that i wont have to look back and review this material when i am finally employed as an engineer.
i am taking this course as a prereq for the kin major.
"10, 2020 i am here because it is a requirement for my major and i think physics is a really cool subject to learn."
"i am here at college because the career choices i want to take, require me to to get a degree in biology and also, more importantly, because my parents have sacrificed a lot to make it in this country as far as they could have and they would want me to be better off than they are."
jose castillo reflection honestly im only here because is part of my requirement for my major.
"uhh, oh i would like to be able to apply the labs into real life especially because i think this lab would help me in my major which is kinesiology."
taking this physics class is the building block for my success because i need this class to graduate.
the reason why im in this physics lab is because i need the lab part of this course.
"i really am i here because it is a requirement for my major otherwise, i would have avoided this if i am being complet ely honest."
"since my major is electrical engineering, it requires me to take most of the stem classes, such as physics, chemistry and math."
"i've been tutoring at skyline for about 5 years now, and i intend to keep working there indefinitely, so i may just use my b.s in biochem to garner more opportunities there."
"the short version of that story is that i grew up kind of poor, joined the military at 18 years old, used my va benefits to go school after i separated from active duty, went to art school for a few years, took a class where we learned to develop a mobile application by leveraging preexisting gui's, and that was the moment when i first got exposed to a little bit of stem. if you would have told high school me that i'd be 2 semesters away from graduating with a bs in electrical engineering, i would never have believed it, mostly because my grades were terrible, but also because i had no idea what stem was back then."
"i'm here because i need to be honestly, this class is a requirement for me, but i honestly enjoy astronomy, i like learning about our universe, it's really trippy to me and just like wows me every time i learn something new because it's like why?"
i also took this class because it was a ge requirement but mostly because i find this topic really interesting to me that gives me an interest to go more in depth.
"i am a big fan of engines and to major in that, you need to be in the major you need to be in the stem field."
"i love stem, particularly technology and science because i find it to be stimulating and challenging which is a requirement that i have for myself and the profession i wish to seek."
"and the last reason, i need to do this for graduation requirement so this is necessary."
i'm going into stem to fulfill premed requirements.
markthe reason for me was pretty simple my dad was a welder and i wanted to do something in that realm but i didn't like the labor i was kinda smart so i knew if i put my mind to something i would be able to get any kind of degree i wanted so then i chose the thing i considered above a laborer witch is the person who designed the thing and then i chose mechanical just because it interested me more then any other major so now i'm heremark
i am here because physics 2 is part of my prerequisite for my major.
i am here for the simple reason that this is a prerequisite.
i also picked sfsu because of the great opportunities that i can have at this school in my biology major and also in my rrs minor because of the amazing college of ethnic studies that we have here.
after shadowing in a pt clinic and seeing the work they did i was inspired to follow that path.
my passion is biology and this class is a prerequisite.
"well, i have to take this class for my major, that is why i am in this class initially."
"i'm also remotely here in this class due to covid, so even though everyone is technically in classschool, no one is physically at campus, which is kind of weird, but interesting to test everyone's ability to study and stay focused without a library, which is something that i usually take advantage of."
if i had a choice of not needing to take this class i would because i find physics to be a hard subject for me to understand and on top of that math is heavily related to the subject.
"i have to take physics for medical school prerequisites, but i am so excited by understanding how the world works."
this is because it is a prerequisite for my major which is biology with a concentration in cellular and molecular.
i'm here in this class because i need to take this class for my major.
i am in this class because it is a major requirement for graduation.
"i am here in this physic class because first of all it is one of my required class for my degree, also i do want to learn more about physic ideas and concepts."

i am here for physics 122 which is the lab portion for phys 121.
"in order to become a physical therapist, i need to take specific perquisites before i can apply and this class is one of those prerequisites."
"i thought taking a lot of online classes this semester would be a good thing since we would all be in lockdown and i felt motivated, but don't think i will take a lot of online classes next semester, or at least not a bunch of early ones like i did this semester."
"i will have to use my physics knowledge on my mcat so that is another reason i am in this class, to prep me for my mcat and because it is a requirement for medical school to take a year of physics."
i am here in physics 122 because of the course pathway that is required for major.
my purpose for taking physics is to have it as a prerequisite to fulfill my degree as a cell and molecular biology major.
this class is just part of a long path that i am taking in order to eventually get to the career i want.

"overall, why im here is not only to fulfill a requirement but truly to broaden my knowledge of physics and how it connects with the world in so many different aspects."
i am here because not only is this class a prerequisite for my upper division classes for my major but also because i always wanted to learn the fundamental concepts of physics.
"but if we are talking about the personal matter, i am here also to learn and it is one of my requirements to take this course."
"i am here to fulfill my prereqs for my major, environmental science."
i am also here because i need to take this class to fulfill my ge as well as a requirement for my major.
"i need the prerequisite just as much as anyone else and besides, thats a pretty mundane reason to include."
i am here because i'm majoring in computer science and this is a prerequisite to the other classes i'm going to have to take later on.
my name is laura ornelas and i am here to help complete my degree and graduate so i can be able to work along side athletes or become a personal trainer.
first and foremost i am taking this class because i need it to graduate.
"however, if i have learned anything from my other classes, even if you are not trying to have a career in this field it can still help you."
"therefore even though i wouldnt have necessarily taken this class if it wasnt required, i am glad that i am in this class because it will be beneficial."
"personally, i'm taking this class because it is a major and general requirement in order for me to pass college."
im also here because i need to take this class as a prerequisite for my biology major.
i am here in this class because it's corequisite along phys 111.
i am here because i am a biology major and physics is a requirement to earn my degree.
ryan gironwhy am i here?normally my answer would be a required component for my major.
i once had a physics teacher in high school that said it is important to understand physics first in order to understand all other sciences so i believe that after this course i will be well equipped for the rest of my major classes.
"going more into depth as to why am i here, i am here because physics will be beneficial for my major in biochemistry and future career in the medical field.having a fundamental knowledge of physics will strengthen my problemsolving skills."
the reason why i am here is because it is a class that i must take since i am a science major.
this class is a required course i have to take in order to graduate within my major so that is why i am taking it.
hi i'm sam and i am here in general physics class because it is required for my major which is micro biology and i think learning physics would help with what i want to be in the future which is a clinical lab scientist where i'm sure is needing a lot of critical thinking and problem solving.
im here at sfsu as a transfer student to get my b.s. in biology with a concentration in physiology so that i can apply for medical school or dental school after.
"another main reason is that this course is a required course for me, because i need to get credits from this course to graduate"
"well honestly, i am here because it is part of my pre req requirements to get into dental school."
i am here in this class to fulfill a requirement for my major.
i am here because i am a biochemistry major and physics is a part of the prerequisites to meet this major.
i am here firstly because this class is a prerequisite for my degree in zoology.
"i want to be able to truly feel like i belong in the stem field and to do that i need to understand the maths that are required for stem. with the support of my teachers and peers, i will come away from this class successfully."
this lab is here to help me grow my knowledge which will also help me in my future school years because i will have to take more physics class due to my major.
i am in this class to fulfill my general education area.
i'm here because this is the requirement.
as a biology major one of the requirements is physics.
"i know nothing about physic, never took a physics class in high school so this is all new to me.i started off by attending sf state as a business major but always had a passion for nursing so i started to take some prereqs for nursing but after figuring out the process in order to get into to nursing program it brought down my hopes of majoring in nursing.i started to think what other major interests me and after doing research i decided that construction management was a great option for me since i had plans of owning a construction company in the future."
"i am here to finish my studies in pursuit of achieving an environmental sciences degree, though, i am still unsure of exactly where id go in the field and what directly interests me, i still feel i have time to figure this out."
"i decided to attend san francisco state university for this major because the major was not impacted, it is an easy commute from home, i like the city of san francisco in general with its historical places and famous pier 39, and sfsu is where my brother attended and he graduated from this institution quite quickly."
i think i am here taking this class because it is a requirement to go into my major.
i am here because physics is a prerequisite for physiology and i think it's because physics can help explain some physiological mechanisms such as tension in the bones and muscles.
i am here because i need to take and pass some general classes in order to graduate.
for me this class its kind of a step to get into my major but also i'm excited to learn about physics.
i am in this class in order to fulfill a prerequisite for physical therapy school because that is the career i would like to go into.
"i am taking physics mostly because it is a requirement to sign up for physical therapy programs, but because i also enjoy math and science."
i am also taking this class to fill a requirement for my major.
i am here taking this physics class so i can be prepared in what i will be studying in and beyond my major..it will prepare me for my future classes since i will need to use physics knowledge.
this will prepare me to be successful in my upper division courses.
i am here taking this class because it is a requirement towards my major.
"september 2nd, 2020im taking physics because i want to major in biology and its a necessary course."
"i am here for multiple reasons, the primary one being to meet my last requirement for graduation."
i am taking this class mainly because it is a prerequisite course for the next physic class in the sequence for my biology major.
i am here because this class is a requirement for my biology major.
"to put it simply, i am here because this is a prerequisite for my major classes later down the line of my college career."
i am taking the course of physics to open my learning about the matter of science.
"id like the imagine physics as an easy general education class, which would have been a lot easier when i was young and immature, but after so many physical science classes over the past couple of years in community college i am unable to take this class so lightly."
"i joined this class at first because i wanted to clear the ge hold, so not so much of an expectation of any kind."
i am here because this class is a requirement for my major.
i am here in sf state because it has the major of biology with a concentration of physiology that will guide to become a doctor.
"i am honestly just trying to fill in a prerequisite, however i am pretty nervous of taking this class, i took physics ap in highschool and it did not go so well, i understood nothing and i failed the class."
"for this class, i am here because it is one of the prerequisite classes that i have to take for my major."
"to start off, i am here in this class as a class requirement for my major, as well as understanding how physics is the theory of life as most have described."
i am here in this class because i need this class for my major which is biology.
"i would summarize my reasoning by saying that there are three components to the reason why i'm here: i'm interested in physics, i wan't to feel more prepared in future physics classes, and, of course, ""because i have to."""
"furthermore, i am here learning physics because it is not only a requirement for my major, but because i am excited to learn the subject itself and how it applies to our everyday lives."
"in the context of school, is i am here for the reason i'm on the path to become a doctor."
i am here because i was referred to this class by an advisor at orientation that this class would help me better understand my calculus ii class i am taking in the spring semester 2020.
i am here because i want to improve my calculus 2 skills and i want to get better grades and the only way to do it is by actually coming to this class.
"part of my major requires me to finish math classes, and i wanted to get help with that because classes can be challenging and hard to understand sometimes, and its helpful to have assistance from classes like this in order to feel more confident about my math skills and learn more."
i am here in this class because i want to make sure i succeed and get a better than a passing grade.
i aspire to get into kinesiology as my major and this physics class is a prerequisite for it.
that is why i am here.but also i am here cause its a pre req for biomechanics
im in physics 240 and 242 because its a requirement for my degree.
the obvious answer on why i'm here is because i need to take a physics lab class for this spring semester.
"good afternoon, or whatever part of the day you're reading this during, i hope its good.i am here in this class because i want to major in mechanical engineering, and this is the last physics class that is required for my prereqs (yay!)."
it has some fundamental concepts that will further help me understand my other major course.
"for me, i would say that i am here in lab tonight because i am working towards a mechanical engineering degree and this was a mandated course."
im here in this classroom because it is required if i want to pass this class with a good grade.
"this lab class is a required course for a major in astrophysics, which i am pursuing."
"taking physics at sfsu is a requirement, but more importantly i am here to help better apply the concepts i learn in this class to my higher education and use this as a stepping stone to other areas of study i will come across."
being in this sci course it's because i want to be able to do good in my physics class these past couples of semesters has been really hard and these sci classes have really helped because it helps me understand what's going on in class and where exactly i need help.
"in addition, in order to succeed and become my career i have to first get a bachelor in biology, and i would get it by graduating from sfsu. lastly, i am here to be able to help my family out, and support them economically."
"i will in this class because, i want to be more good on chem 180, my english skill is not that good so i need more time to understand the topic, and the topic is really new to me so i want to relearn it again."
im here primarily because the computer science department requires me to take a physics course.
markim here because i need to take this class in order to pursue my engineering career which i want to eventually use this degree and work with carsmark
hello!im here because i have to fulfill this prerequisite for my computer science degree.
i am here because it is part of one of my major classes.
i am here because it is one of my last classes i need to graduate.
i am a computer engineering major and the reason that i'm a here is because i love the science of it and also because this is the path to achieving my goal.
i took this class because it is a requirement for my major but after the first couple of lectures i found the class material interesting.
"i am here because my major is computer science, therefore i am taking this course in order fulfill the requirement."
im here in this class because it was required by my major to take it.
"i do like physics although i would not say i am good at it, i know that it would be very helpful to understand main concepts so i can apply them to my work if i ever go into making video games or some type of 3d project."
"the reason why i am here, and more focusing on the specific class is because i need the extra help in chemistry."
i am in this science 215 because i really need to have a deeper understanding of the chemistry class and the material that is taught.
"i am majoring in biochemistry and this is one of the classes i must take, however, it is only one step to aid my plans in the future."
in this class specifically i am here to make up a grade that i received in my first year.
the reason why i'm taking this sci class is to improve my grade for chem 215 as this class is more about calculation than chem 115.
"by being in this class i believe i can not only pass chem 215 with a better grade, but also get through it with a better understanding of the material and so that is why im here."
i am here today in astronomy lab simply because it's general education course i have to fulfill in order to continue on with upper division courses or to even graduate.
im in this class as part of the journey to earn a bachelors degree in child and adolescent development.
i am here because astronomy is lab science that fills out my ge requirements.
physically i am in this class i am here because i want to graduate from college and i need these credits plus i like learning about astronomy.
im in this class to complete my courses and get where i need to be.
i need to pass this class to get rid of a ge 2.
"i am here because i am required to take this class, well to be exact, i have to take any lab class."
i am here because astronomy 116 is a course i am required to take alongside astronomy 115.
"originally, im here in this class because san francisco state university has a requirement for a science lab in order to complete a bachelors degree."
i am here because i need a lab in order to fulfill my general ed requirements.
"i am here because it is apparently required if i take the astronomy lecture course, which i am."
but in the smaller picture in this class i am here because i need this class as a requirement to be able to graduate and get my degree and move onto my career.
im in this class because i am an arts major and terrible at science and picked the science class that would be semi interesting but also satisfy my ge credit.
i am here because i wanted to further my education and move away but wanted to still have a chance to be free.
"in addition, in order to succeed and become my career i have to first get a bachelor in biology, and i would get it by graduating from sfsu. lastly, i am here to be able to help my family out, and support them economically."
i am in this sci class because it will help support my knowledge for my organic chemistry ii class.
"there are many reasons why am i here, the first being that i really want the extra support in order to do well in my academics especially in my science classes."
i am here because i needed to take a lab in order to fulfill my requirements for my major.
to start off i'm here in a lab at 9:30am because i want to get this class out of the way along with my physics 220 class because it's a requirement for my cs degree....
i am taking this class mainly because it fits with my schedule and i need it for my requirements.
"first off, i am here because this course is required for my major."
i am here in my 9 am lab because i would like to expand my knowledge and hands on lab skills but also because its a class that i need to take.
i am taking this physics lab technically to meet the requirements for my major.
"as for why i'm here studying physics in this very moment, this lab is a required addition to the lecture component of the course, and while i would have liked to avoid coming in on tuesday at 9:30 am, sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do."
i am here to learn help me better understand the course material and also because i did look into the free tutoring help on campus but since this is a confirmed help session which i get one unit for being enrolled and fulfilling my attendance it was the best fit for my schedule.
"i am in this class to help me understand more, and pass cell bio, so that i may go on to take my upper division electives, and graduate from this school."
"i am in this sci course because sci classes have helped my foundation for almost all my science classes that i have taken at sfsu. but, on a broader scale, i am here dedicating my time and resources to this class because it was ultimately my choice."
i also need some more units after i enroll in all my classes so i think adding this course will help to close the 120 credit gap i need in order to graduate by the end of fall 2020.i'm here to learn and understand the class topics better.
"i am currently taking sci 350, as it is necessary to take the supplemental instruction courses that partner with the stem classes being taken as an seo student."
"overall, being here, in the sci class, it can help me better on the subject better and able to ask more classmates to help me on the topic better and the concept understandable."
the other reason is to just review concepts and to accumulate any credits towards my degree that i can.
i am here to learn help me better understand the course material and also because i did look into the free tutoring help on campus but since this is a confirmed help session which i get one unit for being enrolled and fulfilling my attendance it was the best fit for my schedule.
im here because im taking organic chemistry and ive taken sci classes for other chemistry class and theyre helped so much.
im taking this class currently to fulfill my prerequisites and my major requirements.
"i am in this class to help me understand more, and pass cell bio, so that i may go on to take my upper division electives, and graduate from this school."
i'm in sci 115 because i took chemistry last semester and ended up getting a d. i feel like there were many things that went wrong last semester like juggling extracurriculars was difficult in itself but personally i had a problem with the seminar component of the class specifically.
i am here because i needed the extra units to qualify for financial aid and it worked nicely because it would allow me to work more on chem321.
"my major is microbiology, the clinical lab science track, and this was a requirement."
"alexis banuelos sci 230 feb 11, 2020 i am in this class because i needed another unit and this was like the perfect class because it would allow me to get the credit and gain a deeper knowledge of bio 230."
the class is once a week so it does get hard to be able and fit all 3 days of lecture but we review the major topics and that helps me put the subtopics in place where they correspond to and basically wrapping my head around all the terms that are learned.
i signed up for this sci course in order to get extra support and to try to master everything i need to master to succeed in my goal in acing this class.
the real reason though is that i have to take this for medical school as well so as of right now i guess i am all in.
i am here because this is a prerequisite for biomechanics and major requirement for my major.
i am in this course because i need it for my major.
"in addition, in order to succeed and become my career i have to first get a bachelor in biology, and i would get it by graduating from sfsu. lastly, i am here to be able to help my family out, and support them economically."
"i am here because this is a class that i need to take for my major, bio chemistry."
"like many of us, we are taking this class to fulfill our major requirements."
"because even though it doesnt seems like it i do see some connections between chemistry and physics sometimes such as thermodynamics and vectors also i believe that im here to give me more options of the path i might want to take as i go further in my studies such as a chemical engineering path or bioengineering and having these basic tools will help me have some footing in the subject of i decide thats what im going to do, also this class is important as in the stem field its used quite commonly as it can be so easily applied to the real and everyday life, so it also provides me with the basis of things i would need to apply to problems and thats why i believe i am here."
"i studied business, i am a veteran from army, but something was missing, i wanted to fulfill one of my dreams, so i am pursuing a veterinarian degree."
i am here because i want to get the education that is required to be able to become a doctor.
"well, that depends if someone were to ask me why i was here in this class, physics 111 lab, i would say that i am here to learn about physics and that it is required for me to take this course for my major."
"however, if you were to ask me why i am in this particular physics course, the honest is reason is that because it is required for me to take if i want to earn my degree in biology."
i am in this class only because i am required to take physics.
"i am here in this physics lab class because it is part of my prerequisites for my major, biology with a focus on physiology."
i am here because i need to take physics as a ge class and potentially use the skills i learn in this class for future classes.
i also taking this class because i want to go into graduate school which is a requirement for this class.
"i'm taking this class for my biology major, so i can move on to my next classes and graduate sfsu. i am here to learn physics, to understand the concept of physics and to eventually teach others who do not understand physics."
