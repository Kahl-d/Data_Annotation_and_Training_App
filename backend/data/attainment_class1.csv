i am here for my growth and learning so i can be better than i was before this class.
moving around a lot made it easier for me to become an adaptable person and see the culture differences within our own country.
"my current path is to become a physical therapist because i enjoy communicating with and helping people and as a pt, i will have many opportunities to travel for work."
"right away, i did more research on what an ot does and ever since, i continued taking more classes and hope to attend ot grad school after i graduate with a bs in kinesiology."
"i believe that i am here to also make my parents proud and most importantly, to make myself proud."
"i also want to have a family in the future and be able to take care and provide for them, so i want to have a good job that will help me become financially stable in the near future."
i am here to learn about the body and movements in order to help others become healthier and stronger.
"i am here at school because i want to become a nurse, and that requires a license and degree."
"i feel passionate about helping others that if i could, i would want to be a doctor."
i am here attending sfsu to achieve higher education but also to hopefully find a career.
one reason that i am taking physics is because i need to for my major courses to graduate and achieve my bachelor of science degree in exercise science and movement science.
my mind has not been made up yet if i wanted to go to medical school etc.
anything can happen though till i graduate so i do have time to reflect and process everything in my mind to make the best decision for myself and future.
"i find that it is very fulfilling to create things or put something together, which is another reason i joined stem, and choosing an engineering field specifically."
i still want to continue into the stem field so that i can keep learning new things and working towards earning a degree in stem.
why i want to go into a stem field is because engineering is something that interests me the most.
once i interned at the exploratorium i was set on becoming an artist engineer.
the reason why i want to go into the stem field is because it's a place where i can potentially help improve the world through the engineering aspects.
i want to be part of the new young generation of engineers going into the industry with new ideas and better technology usage to improve how fast a project can be completed.
it's also something very motivating for me to be a first generation in college and the first to be majoring as an engineer so that continues to push me to continue being in the stem field despite how challenging this field is.
"personally for me, i am pursuing a career in the stem field due to me enjoying buildingdesigning objects that serve a purpose in life."
another bonus about the job is that hopefully i'll be earning enough money so that i can support my partner and they will be able to pursue whatever they want in life without having to worry about money.
"i am pursuing my civil engineering and starting out after college will be at least 60,000 which is really high compared to what i am used to now."
my mother always made myself very interested in this major because she is a civil engineer as well.
i didn't really know what i was getting myself into when i first started studying the prerequisite classes for civil engineering.
i want to go into the stem field because i want opportunities to work in a field where i can learn interesting things about the world.
there is always going to be a demand for engineers no matter what.
"this is a super quick overview of why i want to get into the stem field, engineering in particular."
so a big piece of this is to find independence by gaining an engineering degree and then once i have gained that independence then can work towards addressing these many issues.
i think that the engineers without borders program looks like a really cool avenue to work in once i make it to the level of a practicing engineer.
"with all the wildfire activity in california, perhaps theres an engineering solution that can help us address the excess of 20 million acres of fuel load."
"all i know, at this point in my life, are my likes and dislikes, the person i would like to become in the future, and even the person id like to be with for the rest of my life."
"but my main purpose at the moment is to work hard and finish these next 2 years of school to get my bachelors degree in anthropology and minor in recreation, parks, and tourism."
while i am helping the plant with my small contributions i am also studying to become a therapist with my psychology major.
lesley alexander928023576phys0222reflection 1why do i want to become a computer science major?
"so, i want to be a software engineer for a video company one day, enjoying my favorite hobby and learning at the same time."
i actually plan on transferring out of sfsu to pursue a degree in environmental engineering.
i'm currently studying under a civil engineering degree at sfsu but i want to focus on the material science and carboncapture aspect of engineering.
when i was young i always wanted to grow up and become an engineer.
yet i also really enjoyed drawing; so i decided to choose civil engineering since it offered a heavy focus on math and since while also incorporating drawings of drafts etc.
i have always wanted to grow up and become a stem major because i have always enjoyed exploring mathematics and science.
i currently am trying to major in computer science but i would much rather do electrical engineering.
i only chose computer science because i am hoping to graduate soon since i am 27 years old.
i hope to pursue a masters degree to increase my chances of landing a great job once i graduate.
i would like to complete the transition to electrical engineering if i can complete this class with a greater understanding and with more confidence in myself.
"i genuinely want to become a great mechanical engineer for myself, not for my parents, and i want to become a person who can solve problems no matter how challenging, but i have to first overcome the challenge of graduating.(p.s. this sounded so much more dramatic than it was meant to be now that i read it back, but i just let my thoughts flow.)"
"i want to go into a stem field, computer science specifically, because technology interests me."
"and sitting in my cs classes where i see one other single woman, it starts to become more obvious."
its important to me that the next generation realizes that careers have no gender and just because youre not a prodigy doesnt mean you cant pursue science!
i have always wanted to pursue some sort of career in either botany or astronomy.
"some day when i graduate i hope to work at nasa, charting stars and galaxies and discovering the secrets of the universe."
i have decided to go into the stem field because i have always wanted to be an engineer.
"i have always wanted to major as engineer, but i was unsure what type of engineering i would pursue."
"i loved building things which made me decide civil engineering, but i always enjoyed working with cars since my dad worked and built cars when i was a kid."
working with cars specifically made me decide to switch to mechanical engineering and pursue that as a career goal.
"being in stem requires a lot of hard work and dedication, that's why i wanted to pursue engineering, i enjoy the challenge."
i want to become a game developer and the best way of doing in my opinion was to get into the stem field.
i needed to get a degree within computer science to make myself more competitive for applying for any job in the industry.
deciding to be an engineer is something that i have always struggled with.
during the summer of 2018 i began to have some interest in being an engineer.
"during that summer i participated in multiple engineering internships where we learned how to build, design, and create little projects that used arduino's."
that was when i figured out that i wanted to be an engineer.
i learned that engineering mostly focussed on problem solving and creating products and tools to help solve those problems.
"this aspect of engineering has been in my early age without me even knowing it, and i naturally drifted to that desired discipline unconsciously."
"weimin chenphys 2229102020reflection 1 why do i want to go into the stem field?stem stands for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics."
i want to become a computer programmer and join computer science because it will be important in the future.
"as time goes by, computer technology and engineering will become faster and faster."
"a stem degree can provide me with the hard skills required for recruitment, as well as the flexibility that is important to me to adapt and pursue."
i want to go into the stem field (specifically computer science) so i can pursue software development.
going to school to get a degree and learning the skills necessary to work any related job is what will most likely set me on the path to do what i want in life.
i want to go into the stem field because engineering has been my passion since i began high school.
"in high school, i was apart of the engineering academy all 4 years."
"in those 4 years, i learned a lot about what engineers do and the many innovative accomplishments that have been made because of engineering."
as the years went by i learned of the different types of engineering and realized in my senior year i wanted to become a civil engineer.
"in my freshman year of college, i started researching and eventually interviewed a civil engineer and it reinforced in my brain that this is what i want to become, it fascinates me and i feel like i will be happy in this field of work for the rest of my life."
i loved chemistry and engineering and especially the cosmos.
my career goal is to work at nasa. maybe interning while i continue to earn a doctorate and study engineering.
i am here to graduate.
i am deployed in the us to help with covid19 and i am taking my final class in order to graduate online now because i want to graduate so badly!
i just hope to graduate in december and then it's time to get ready for grad school.
i am here in this class because i plan on pursuing a degree in physical therapy.
i am very grateful for the educational path i am taking as a first generation college student!
i feel like being a physical therapist would be a great job for me because i would be able to care for people and help them improve their gross and fine motor abilities to make their lives easier.
i am here to be a physical therapist.
"but, focusing on the bigger picture, i am also at this school because im fortunate enough to have higher education and the chance to obtain a bachelor's degree."
i am also here because i want to be able to graduate in the four year time period as time is really important to me.
"once i graduate i can go to grad school and start ""it all over again."" after i finish my grad school i can finally actually start my life."
"i have to take physics for medical school prerequisites, but i am so excited by understanding how the world works."
now he is getting his phd in theoretical chemistry and i am pursuing a future in medicine.
i'm here taking general physics ii because it's a prerequisite for one of the graduate schools i want to go to.
"i am majoring in biochemistry, because i feel like it will be helpful for me before i get into medical school."
"i want to get into medical school not to make anyone proud even though it is a plus, but i want to do it for myself, because i have seen many md in different positions in the medical field doing their job and they even show me things that sparks my curiosity and interest even more in science so it just make sense for me to go to medical school, because that is where there are hands on learning of different positions of the medical field."
why am i here?i was in high school when i decided to pursue my studies in the united states.
i am a biochem major and i am looking forward to becoming a pharmaceutical scientist.
"in another sense, i am here because i want to go to medical school, and this class a prerequisite for many of the schools i am looking to apply to."
"previously, i was planning on going to a ph.d program for psychology after undergraduate school, but at the end of my junior year in undergrad i decided i actually wanted to go to medical school."
"i am glad to say, after taking the majority of prerequisites, i feel confident in my self and my ability to get in to medical school and succeed in medical school!"
ultimately i am hoping to go to medical school and study to be a surgeon because i'd like to make a positive impact on the world.
"in the case that i cannot, for whatever reason, finish my intended career path and go through with medical school, i would hope that i'm still doing something meaningful, like working for the center for disease control or in a lab doing important research."
being able to help people gives me purpose in life and makes me feel needed.
this suits well from what i want to do in the future because i want to be a doctor and learning how physics has impacted medicine in a great way is a good thing.
i am here in this class and at san francisco state because i want to become a physical therapist.
"this is my third year here at sfsu, and i am starting to take more and more major classes as well as classes (like this one) for prerequisites for doctorate of physical therapy programs."
"by taking time to finish college and complete all my prerequisites, i am able to set myself up to one day be able to get to medical school."
the reason im majoring in biochemistry and seeking a higher education is in hopes of attending medical school.
besides hoping to one day become a doctor i also really enjoy learning.
"learning is my favorite thing to do and i really enjoy the opportunity college has given me to explore different subjects, such as physics, but also subjects not even in the college of science and engineering like my minor in human sexuality studies."
"going to college, especially one like san francisco state university, has really allowed me to expand my horizons and become an even more open minded and curious person."
"the reason why i came to this major , which lead me to take this class, is because i am fulfilling my goal into getting into medical school."
i'm here because i want to go to graduate school.
"in order to become a physical therapist, i need to take specific perquisites before i can apply and this class is one of those prerequisites."
"the fact that i am trying to become a pharmacist, it is only natural that i have to be a biochemistry major."
i guess i'm here today (in this physics course) to fulfill my requirements to graduate and become a vet.
"for so long, being chinese american, i had it in my head that i ""wanted"" to be a doctornurse."
i found it hard to not have encouragement to finish school and becoming something i wasn't sure about and being told to finish school and that i was suppose to become those things.
"after attending the san francisco state university, i will transfer to medical school because i want to become a dermatologist."
i want to transfer to ucsf or the university of washington as my graduate school.

another reason why i am here is because in the future i want to get into the medical field to become a pediatrician and also work in a lab.
i used to want to be a doctor but i changed opinion.
to graduate with a degree that will get me a job in the area i like i have to graduate in biochemistry.
to graduate in that major i need to take a whole bunch of physics.
i am here because my long term educational goal is to get a phd in food chemistry.
the reason i am pursuing a phd is because i do not know anyone that as one in my circle.
"i hope that one day when i graduate from college and become a vet, my family will be proud of me and know that i didnt only go it for my own benefit, but theirs as well."
today i assume we're going to learn about vectors and how we can use them on a coordinate plane to view motion in a simple manner.i'm here to further my education and complete requirements for my major in order to graduate.
i am here in class because i aspire to help people regain motion in their body by being a physical therapist.
i am here to learn as much as a can about the universe so that i can eventually contribute to making a positive change for the earth andor humanity.

"though i can't really predict my future, i hope i'll be able to make people happy and find a career in the medical field since i'm still unsure now."
"i'm also here at sfsu to pursue a career that i really enjoy, i have worked in a physical therapy clinic for the past year and it's something that i really want to do."
"i have wanted to become a doctor for as long as i can remember, and taking courses in subjects such as physics and chemistry (aside from biology of course) are part of that journey."
"because of my career interest, going to college is just something i have always expected of myself.since it has been a while since i have taken physics, and courses are online this semester, i am a bit nervous but also excited to see what this semester and class will bring."
the knowledge gained from going to sfsu is being able to pursue a career as either a physical therapist or occupational therapists.
"of course, if there's a deeper meaning then it is because i am a first generation college student for my family and seeing how hard they've worked to provide for me and my siblings, i definitely want to return the favor ten fold by earning a degree and getting a good pay jobing."
"i want to become a surgeon and i still think that physics is important because it helps people get an understanding of how much force to use and at what angle to use tools, such as how one should angle a blade or saw and how much pressure to use."
"going more into depth as to why am i here, i am here because physics will be beneficial for my major in biochemistry and future career in the medical field.having a fundamental knowledge of physics will strengthen my problemsolving skills."

physics 112 happens to be one of those requirements and i am happy that i am here as it will take part in the knowledge i will need to know in medical school.
i am very motivated as well as passionate about becoming a doctor because of the lack of attention of medical assistance my community has faced.
"i wish there were more doctors of color in my community because i feel that i could have related to them more as well as connected with them as in aspects of culturally, physically, mentally, and emotionally."
i want to become a doctor so that low income communities do not have to worry about receiving efficient health care.
"i want to support communities such as the one i grew up in through my doctorate degree because so many ethnic groups are underrepresented, medicine is needed by everyone of every race."
im here because i want a better future for my family and i. i am here because i would be the first in my family to have attended and hope to graduate from college.
the reason i want to be a dentist is because my family is oral surgeon and when i graduate everything is going to be ready for me.

"i am here at sf state because it is on the path to a future career, in order to become an anesthesiologist i must first get my degree and then go to medical school in order to be able to help people in their time of need."
"in the future, i plan to be a doctor and i will need to have a good understanding of physics in order to properly help people."
"also, since i chose a major that best prepares me for medical school; cell biology b.s. this is a requirement in my major in addition to physics two and lab."
this was a career in wildlife rehabilitation or wildlife conservation.
"in addition, i have always enjoyed watching shows on animal planet such as dog whisper, pitbulls parolees, animal cops, pit boss and aspca. these shows further made me realize that i wanted to pursue a career that involved helping animals of any size."
i want to pursue my career as being a nephrologist (doctor that specializes in kidneys.) although this class.
some of my goals are to become a brain surgeon or a researcher.
so i want to become a physical therapist to be able to do what i love while i also help others.
i'm also here because i'm a biology major and i want to be able to hopefully one day be able to work with kids and become a pediatrician.
"im here so that i can graduate, pursue my career and expand my knowledge in life."
"to be quite honest, this class is necessary for my degree and most likely to get into medical school."
"its a shallow answer, but if i had to elaborate then i would say that this class is a step towards becoming a doctor."
ive wanted to become a doctor for as long as medical books have existed in libraries.
"when my other friend who was much closer to her said to me, i hope you become a great doctor so you can help people like her, i knew that my ambitions were personal."
"in the career i want to pursue, i have to take the mcat, which involves a section of physics, to get into medical school to soon become an anesthesiologist."
i am here because i want to go to medical school someday.
"not here just for the requirement, but to gain knowledge that can be useful in my life and in graduate school in the future."
more than that though because i am trying to become a mechanical engineer.
"if i do not, i will not be able to become an engineer."
i hope to be able to pass with flying colors in this class because i was really good at physics in high school all though i did tend to spend almost every single day after class bugging my teacher on how to solve a problem.
to get back to the point though he inspired me to go onto engineering.
he made engineering sound like something anyone could do.
i recently graduated from usf in may and i am currently taking classes here at sfsu to meet my pre req requirements.
i graduated with a kinesiology degree at usf and i want to pursue physical therapy in the future.
i'm here because i would like to pursue a career in bio physiology.
"physics 1 is a major requirement which is technically why i am taking this particular class, but the bigger picture is why that i would like to have a career in something medical, maybe nursing, but i still have a lot to figure out before i officially graduate."
i also learned about the kind of fast track program to work on my master's in kinesiology while i am finishing up my bachelor's degree.
"so to the question of why i am here is that i am trying to finish up my degree in kinesiology to pursue a career as a strength and conditioning coach at the college level, and to do so i need to complete this class to be able to continue my major classes."
i am here so i may accomplish my goal to graduate on time and continue on to get my masters (most likely in a different university) which hopefully will lead me to get the career choice that i want.
this class will give me one of the requirements that i need to eventually graduate from here so i can hopefully go on to law school.
"the reason i am here today is because i have changed my major three separate times, and i have finally chosen to pursue my dream major of being a scientist."
my dream is to become a lawyer and someday have the money o be able to provide for my family.
"""why am i here?""i am here to become more educated, so that i may grow as a person, academic, and professional."
i was required to take this course as a form of foundation to build on the classes i need to get a career in envriontal science and my degree.
"i know i want to become an exotic veterinarian, but i feel like i am not smart enough to get into vet school."
i am at sfsu because i want to get a college education and graduate from a college without having to pay an extreme amount of money for tuition like other colleges have.
i am a prebiochemistry major and hope i can refresh my math for my calculus class because i have not been in a math class since fall 2018.
i want to get a degree in biology emphasizing in marine biology.
i am here at sfsu to graduate as a bio major.
i am here at sfsu as a bio major because i want to be a doctor and i want to go to med school after this.
for a bio major physics is required to graduate so that is why i am in this class.
i am here in physics 112 in order to get the prerequisites for my goal of becoming a physical therapist.
"although i had graduated from sfsu in spring 2019, i came back in order to get these prerequisites for grad school to become a physical therapist."
"although i am not the best physicist, i know these topics of motion can really help me in the future graduate courses as well as in the profession."
"apart from this being a required course for my biology major, i guess i would have to say i'm here so that i can continue to pursue my goal of being in the medical field in the near future."
"i'm currently on track to pursue a veterinarian career with a concentration in zoology within my biology major, however, i'm keeping my options open."
another reasons that i am here in school because i want to graduate from college and being able to attend medical school.
i am here in sf state because it has the major of biology with a concentration of physiology that will guide to become a doctor.
it is a basic stepping stone in order for me to graduate with my major of biology (concentration on cell and molecular) from sfsu. i need to take 2 semesters of physics and pass in order to move forward in my journey.
"after i graduate from sfsu i will then apply for medical school to become a pharmacist at ucsf, which is the overall and main goal i have for myself!"
"generally, i'm here in college because i would need to get a degree in order to be a chiropractor."
