this can also make new opportunity to meet people who have the same major as me.
"i also have an interest of one day teaching this class, because i think its important to help my community."
it bothered me at first but it was also nice to see that most of my friends from community college ended up coming here as well.
having that small transfer group actually helped me a lot in my classes this past semester because were all engineering majors.
as a firstgeneration college student it has been really hard to figure this out and try and find ways to help me in my classes these sci classes has really helped me reach out and find people who have the same goals as me and to have a study group of my own and be able to ask questions outside of class.
"i also wanted to join the class, because unlike chem 180 with 100 students, this class is pretty coo just being about 10 people entirely."
especially when we were preparing for the first exam they gave me the cheat sheet and helped me with questions.
i am here to get help on chem 180 and to pass the class with a b or higher i heard from my friends that the class is difficult.
when my t.a. told us about a tutoring class where i can receive a unit for showing up and getting help.
i am hoping that this class will also take some stress off of the studying aspect of chem 180 and will allow me to study better by having perfect opportunities to discuss the material with the instructors and with my classmates.
i think because the facilitators are students who took the class prior really helps because they can help us in improving our study skills.
i feel that working in groups help you find what mistakes you are doing when studying for a test or solving a specific physics problem.
we are all here to help each other pass the lecture class of physics 121.
"these sci classes will help me accomplish that through, making myself accountable to go to class each week and get extra help."
"it is very helpful to have someone in the same shoes as you, since you are taking the class together it is a much better time to get to know your class mates and forum study groups."
so far from the first three weeks four weeks of class i have gotten as on all my quizzes given in my main classes thanks to my sci helper classes.
when i was preparing for the first exam i was able to ask my sci instructors for help and the material that was given to us really helped me understand the general concept.
"the reason why i am here, and more focusing on the specific class is because i need the extra help in chemistry."
i know the reason why everyone is in the class because they have similar reasons like i do; being able to connect with one another and build more information together.
"i realized the more people you know the extra help you can get with the sections i am struggling with, because someone is bound to know that topic by the heart or know a different way to explain."
getting different opinions and ideas is always helpful to me.
"so, with the help of my sci professors and classmates i hope i am able to pass this class."
i truly want an a and the only way i can do that is being on top of work and getting help from people or anyway possible.
"it's great that i'm not the only person in that class that needs help, i do have my friends in that class."
"we can help each after sci class, sometimes we don't get to sit with one another during in class but that's okay."
"these sci classes will help me accomplish that through, making myself accountable to go to class each week and get extra help."
"it is very helpful to have someone in the same shoes as you, since you are taking the class together it is a much better time to get to know your class mates and forum study groups."
so far from the first three weeks four weeks of class i have gotten as on all my quizzes given in my main classes thanks to my sci helper classes.
we can help each other on topics that we are not strong in.
sometimes in such a big classroom it is hard to ask questions to your professor which was another reason why i signed up for this class because i get one on one help from my peers and also the sci facilitators.
i also want to be able to pass chem 215 with an a which is why i signed up for sci so i can get the extra help to pass the class.
it also easier to ask questions and get help so i don't fall behind in class and get motivated to study more.
so i am here taking this class mostly because i need help.
i just like the help from everyone.
"first of all, i am in this class to get as much help as i can with chemistry."
"with this class, i not only hope to get as much help as i can but also to meet people in order to make a study group and make connections for the future."
"in addition, i want to get better at public speaking and i feel that this class can help with that since i might consider being a tutor for a lower level science class."
the most helpful part of the course is when we sit in groups and the team work really helps due to peer mentoring.
i am here in a sci course because i have an awareness of my chemistry and math abilities and i know that i could use the extra help.
i also think that this sci class is a good way to meet more people and i always look to my peers for extra support.
its also fun getting to collaborate with the other students in the class.
i also like how sci class allows you to meet other students that you can turn to for help and form study groups with.
"plus, i was able to meet other peers who are looking to major in biology and since some of us relate with each other, i can ask for advice on which classes to take for the next semester in order to keep me on the right track."
"this concept isnt easy for me to grasp and now since bio240 mostly feels like theoretical information and a lot of words, being here and studying with others taking the class will help me and motivate me to keep pursuing the task to be successful and will give me the motivation to get that passing grade."
"i am here because i need a good grade for the course and i believe that this sci course, just like last semesters, will definitely allow me to acquire nothing below a b. i am also here because it allows me to associate much more with my fellow colleagues and help each other out to take down any type of problems and questions that we need help on."
like it is said the students kind of lead the conversation into the class and i like that people actually converse with each other and engage in the topic.
it also helps me to create study groups at other times.
"i have to take ochem i in order to take biochemistry, which i need for my major and i heard about this class when brent came in to invite students to add the course."
in the past i found that i would always study by myself but it helped when i would study with others.
it is great to hear about how other students do their problem solving as well as how they study so that way i could think about picking up study habits from them.
i hope this course will help me to clear any confusion that i have had during lecture and work it out with my peers.
i stuggle making friends or gathering the courage to make plans with classmates to study together outside of class.
"it helps to trap others in a small confined space, thus minimizing their possible escape options, and forcing them to talk to me."
im also taking this sci class to help with my time management on studying.
i am here to help get myself a better grade.
i also will feel less intimidated because the people teaching the class and more my peers than they are my instructor.
this is also a way for me to meet people in this course that i could gain some help with as well as help them (to the best of my ability).
also to possibly see if there others in my other courses that maybe we could help each other in those courses as well.
we are here to be inspired by the loads of information that make us who we are.
also this class allows me to sit with students and just ask questions about related topics aswell like from my 451 class.
"since some people are taking the same parent class as i am, i am able to connect with these people and we are able to benefit each other by discussing our lecture and creating study groups to prepare ourselves for tests or to help each other with homework."
so far it's been helpful sitting in a table with other classmates discussing and solving problems that are challenging at some point.
"details are important specially refreshing some math from previous classes that are covered during this class, not such good examples using matlab but at least they provide a general idea."
"also, in this class, i could to make some classmates that i never seen before and able to get their help as a group work assignment to do some of the problems on the worksheet that had given in this course."
this sci class can help me to more practice problems on the topic that might talk about it during the class times and it would might show out the topic for the help on the subject better.
i also find it very helpful to have my peers explain certain concepts rather than my professor on certain topics.
i feel very lucky to have access to this help from my peers and i look forward to challenging myself academically this semester.
"i want to become a doctor because i have a personal mission or purpose, which is to help people."
working as a group can help break down difficult problems or text and write good dates and notes.
by working together the group can find solutions that work best and complete projects in a quicker and more efficient amount of time than others.
"i believe that this class will help me out since i lack on actually practicing with the lesson material and just study everything a day or two before the big test, quiz, or exam."
and notice that the teachers of this class are students just like me and that made me feel relieved and more comfortable.
this is my first time taking a tutoring class and i knew i made the right choice deciding to take this science class i will need the help with chemistry either i took this or not.
"whether it would be biology or chemistry, i knew that i would need extra support when it comes to science."
i am glad my professor told us about sci courses and i will be enrolling again in the fall semester.
"since it was my first time in this class, i enjoyed every bit of it how we can not be afraid to ask questions, and how you help us on our individual needs and encourage us and push us to do good in chem 115."
"it is also nice to be able to meet people who know the struggle of being a stem major, it allows us to finally relate."
"also, having former chem 321 students as the sci 321 instructors may help me gain a different perspective of the course that the teacher may not give."
emilyn nunez9.19alma week 3im in college because i know that i can make a change in my community.
that everything i do with my life will not only help my family but everyone in my community.
i have a drive to do better in a world that constantly belittles my community.
the only way that im able to create a better future for my community is by getting a phd and create data dedicated in my community and create policy targeted towards my community.
"im in love with research and the beautiful ness of my mexican community, but weve been criminalized and dehumanized, and i want to change that."
i know that i still have years until i finish my life academically but i know that i want to do everything to help my community.
going to college will let you network with people and make good connections which can go a long way.
"i love biology and i want to use that love for biology and put it to use helping people, which is why i want to become a doctor."
i hope to also network and meet new people because i am new to this school and area and the opportunities that come with networking could be endless.
if i decide this is what i really want to do i feel like adding this course i could use the extra help.
i won't be as stressed trying to find people who could help me study.
i see the value in networking and getting to know my fellow colleagues.
i see the opportunity to give and receive help.
"all in all, i am happy with this course as it seems to be here only to help."
my purpose within entering the biofield is to give back to the community and to commit to an environment where medicine is involved.
as well it is a great network tool to meet more people that are moving into the same or similar major that i am intending to work towards.
i have met many people that i now talk to outside of class and help each other with assignments and made our own mini study groups at the library.
"with this class, i not only hope to get as much help as i can but also to meet people in order to make a study group and make connections for the future."
i chose to take sci 230 to have a larger community around me so i could have more structure and help with bio 230.
"also it's helpful to hear things from student's perspectives rather than a professor, and have people to bounce ideas off ofask questions i don't ask in lecture."
taking physics in high school made me gain interest in the subject because my teacher was very passionate and my classmates were all nice and helpful.
i get the same feeling in my lecture and lab because some of the people there really try to work together and work through solutions since the class can be difficult at times
i think the purpose of college is to prepare students for the real world by helping students become more well rounded.
"however, i have already taken an equivalent to this class at my community college that i have transferred from."
i have heard from previous students that this class that this is a class that is to not be taken lightly.
