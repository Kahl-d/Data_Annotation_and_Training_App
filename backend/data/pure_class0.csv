i mainly want to emphasize more on the formula usage in this course as that is what i have struggled most on in the past.
"not in a bad way, but just to remind me on my motives."
"i don't expect it to be exactly the same, but i do think that it will be very similar."
not going to lie sometimes i dont feel like i can just because most of the classes are hard and especially doing every class online makes it harder for me.
the appeal of making a decent amount of money and being able to consistently challenge myself to learn new things has drawn me here.
i am in this supplemental science course as form of extra preparation for mt upcoming exams for the next three months.
this is a very broad statement so im going to take it in the aspect of why am i in school and why am i in this class.
other then that im still looking for an area or field that i like or that would be interesting.
"so to answer the question why am i here, i'm here for nothing."
"so i think i kind of wanting to have like a recap of what i've learnt, and learn more of what i haven't learnt as well, because i kinda liked physics."
"i found that with labs, the material or concepts are more fully ingrained in my understanding overall."
we are living in a world that involved physics and we dont even know about it.
i know pay should not really be the main reason on goes into a major but i enjoy the fact that my major does implement physics in it.
"with modern science and modern machines, we take physics to learn the basic science of these new technological developments and how they work."
to be quite fair i'm not sure what anyones purpose is on the planet.
i also know that the time allotted for the professors are not enough to begin with.
"astronomy shares the unknown with me, and the beauty as well as the danger it holds beyond our earth."
"from my parent's personal experience, i've seen how stepping into the stem field has greatly effected their finances for the better and i would also want that same experience, but ten fold."
"i know i am in this class for a couple of reasons, one being that it is a requirement for me to move on with my major and overall my field of study, so i can be who i was meant to be."
i feel that this major might fit me the best because i have heard that electrical engineers does lots of calculations and test they creations to see if it works properly.
"my major, which is biochemistry, is really why im here."
"i am taking physics to satisfy a prerequisite for my major, general biology."
last semester i decided to take physics to complete another prerequisite and i signed up for the lecture.
it might not be directly related but biology still has some physics in it.
i definitely don't want to move somewhere where it is hot all the time.
im here to learn and will try my utmost best to obtain a b grade ill take a c but want to aim for a b. the reason a is not mentioned is because i realize the challenge in front of me and with current course load i will be multifocusing so all my time and effort will not be in this class alone.
i took chem 115 last semester with a sci class and it helped me get an a in the class.
in physical therapy patients manipulate objects with forces.
"so in a way i did, in fact, choose to be here in this class."
"my religion is sikhism and i really am grateful that i am sikh because it really accepts any person, no matter what race you are, gender, or anything."

to get a better and broader perspective of life.
"other than that, maybe someone has a genuine interest in physics."
i am glad i took this class because the students are really nice and the professor is cool and helpful and really understanding.
"it helps me solve problems better and better recognize patterns in general, which has helped me tremendously in reading and organizing code."
"i am taking physics lab with lecture because, in the lecture, i will learn the basics and understand physics and its different aspects, but in the lab, i get to be more handson even though classes are online."
"as for this sci course, it will help me learn tricks and skills to do well in my organic chemistry course, pass the exams, and overall exceed in the course."

"i am here because it has been some time since i have taken chem 115, and this has made me very nervous about taking chem 215."
i have taken physics in high school but i did not do so well.
i also want to learn from my peers and instructors on how to approach chemistry.
my major is general biology and i am not sure what career path i am choosing yet.
any bit of motion from a praising walking to a rocket flying in southeast speeds and accelerations displays that physics can happen anywhere.
i am not a math person.
as of now i was thinking about doing forensics after i get my degree in b.a chemistry.
"i am here because when i applied for transfer, this was the only school i got accepted to."
it's been helping so far because we do go over a lot of information.
taking this class helps me get a better and more broad view on the field im studying.
"another reason why i am here is that i rather take physics 2 than calc 2 because it feels better to take and not only that, but to me it is way more interesting."
i'm prepared for what's ahead and look forward to expanding my understanding of what i already know.
i am at sfsu because i was unhappy at my former university.
"to get a higher education, to experience a sort of working environment while making friends and making contacts with people that might help me out in my future, such as having references in classmates or professors that ive interacted with and had for my courses."
"i may be thinking now that i will not use this information outside of this class however, if i eventually learn this to not be true i will be grateful for having taken this course and being prepared for my career even more."
i did not think it was going to be as hard as it was but i am still here nonetheless.
both of these classes helped me through my classes.
i chose the major kinesiology because of my background in sports and my love for health and fitness.
i am currently a fourthyear but is a junior standing.
i just hope i can pull it off.
i rather ask for help than to figure it out myself.
"to have this kind of basic understanding of physics helps me realize the importance of my life in this present moment, i am in a crucible of knowledge that i can soak in and construct a new found appreciation of the world i am in."
they told me a lot about how it was such a struggle to not be able to spend as much time with me when i was little and that it was hard to be in school as an adult and it is better to get it done earlier than they did.
"i heard in one of elon musk's podcast that within the next 10 years he wants to start building tunnels underneath the los angeles freeways to make traffic better, and that would be a cool project to work on."
"personally, the reason why i am here is that i decided to study physics to do research and business."
i am here because i have finally made up my mind.
by the time i got here at sfsu i decided to just do it.
i like labs where is hand ons or visual so hopefully this class is like that.
i am here in this physics class because it is a requirement for my major.
"since starting physics, i understand now that almost every thing that i am going to be doing for science needs to be backed up by data and i need to understand why some things happen the way that they do."
i am here in sci 305 because i'm at the literal end of my line.
"lastly, i am here because it was meant for me to be here and take on the journey call life."
"this course will also benefit me in case i decide to take the second physics course, physics 121, later on."
i wanted to go into the stem field because my great grandfather was a civl engineer and i have always looked up to him.
stem is really interesting to me.
i cannot wait to see what type of obstacles my group and i are going to take on and how we will tackle it.
"i think assuming there is a purpose behind my existence implies i was ""created"" and imbued with that purpose from the beginning."
"i plan to put 20 hours a week towards calculus two, with this supplemental class to give myself a steady foundation."

"i do not know how challenging chem 321 will be for me, but i know that as with other chemistry courses, it takes a lot of practice to learn."
i have never been that interested in physics in all honesty.
so far i got an a in the first test so...
"being comfortable is very important, especially when moving alone, because of the high chance of home sickness that can arise when making major changes."
i have 3 labs a week so it's hard trying to understand all the material.
physics is one of the most intriguing subjects in my opinion and it is seen everywhere you go throught you're entire life.
"i get shy to participate so i just observe, listen, and take notes as much as i can."
i am a follower of jesus so i do believe there are purpose for why i'm specifically at this school.
i will like more sections open because some of the classes time doesn't fit our schedule.
if taking this course means that i will get closer to my goals than i will happily take this course.
"in conclusion, i would say i am here for a quality education and to meet new people from different backgrounds."
the question why am i here? is a very broad question.
i am thankful for all of the opportunities we have to look forward to together in california.
schooling is important because after we are done we will be released into the world with the ideas we have been forced to learn and with all that information we have to make money.
"i am in college to learn as much as i can because i think the more i learn, the more capable i am of thinking well, of being useful, and the more beautiful and amazing i think the world around me is."
"the reason i am in this class is because im taking physics 111 and they told me i also had to take the lab, so i decided to do both classes in the same semester."
"during grade school, i taught myself how to play several instruments."
"if we can put meanings into the things we do, what is the point in doing anything at all?"
"for a more existential answer, i have no clue and don't really care.for more on why i'm here, i actually went to community college before transferring over to san francisco state."
"as a joke, she told me to go read some of the books about rocks, minerals, and gemstones and that was exactly what i did!"
"i often forget about what i cant see, but that could improve through the engineering courses ill be taking in the upcoming semesters."
"in addition, i will be able to learn the techniques to measure physical quantities and determine their relationships."
"also, the reason why i am taking this class because it is one of the prerequisites of a graduate program that i am trying to apply."
"by applying the scientific reasoning behind how things work, i can use that knowledge in real world situations, like finding proper measurements of an object to find further information on that object, which then can be used for other purposes."
"i see you're a person of culture, as well."
"this semester,i hope i can learn more experimental abilities and develop good habits of doing experiments in phys 232."
also something i didn't ever think id do.
i enjoy learning about how our world works because it allows me to come up with ideas as to how we can make it better.
i have heard that physics is a hard subject and takes a lot of concentration and time to fully comprehend the world of physics.
"this past semester i changed my major from business with a concentration in accounting to biology (with a concentration in physiology.) during high school, i wanted to go to university and study biology as a premed."
not only am i here to learn about physics but i am also here to meet new people.
but why am i here?
"in order to do it, i found my path that i have to love myself first."
"i probably wouldnt be taking it if i didnt have to, but i definitely do."
i transferred from sjsu this semester after i switched from being a premed student to a computer science major.
i am wondering what is there to physics other than forces?
i am in sci230 because i needed it to reach full time student status.
however i have now realized that they truly help especially since the class itself is a really fun environment within itself and the work we do is learning with one another and not simply copping notes that the professor has written down on the board.
this class will also help build the foundation for my knowledge for computer science.
i have had better understanding with biology as a whole.
i love basketball do not get me wrong.
it also helps with problem solving skills and critical thinkingtwo very important skills to have as a software engineer.
"""why am i here?"" this essay is meant to connect you to your purpose."
with the knowledge and understanding that an engineering degree will bring me i will be able to help solve many problems.
"other than the usual, ""it's my prerequisite for my major and i need to pass this class to succeed"", i genuinely want to learn physics and put concepts into real life experiments."
"to ensure that i stand out as an applicant for veterinary school, i am striving towards a 3.84.0 gpa all throughout college."
im a mechanical engineering major and binary numbers doesnt seem relevant to my major but i do think that understanding how computers work and think.
"its harder for me to completely process all the information in physics, only because the processes and concepts are less familiar to me than the concepts in chemistry and biology."
but there were als things i learned that were discussed later on the week.
"for me personally, i feel that this course is not extremely importantrelated to my major and everyday life."
just your average orange county douchebag and it turns out that he was a data scientist for instagram.
i am here because it is one course closer for me to get my degree.
my goal here are to help myself develop better study skills so i can be less stress and have more time to actually enjoy my time and research im doing on campus.
i also like the idea of being able to teach as a way of memorizing the material that i've learned.
i assume it will not be hard because it is the lab for the introductory physics course.
"i feel that going through that amount of schooling and gaining all that knowledge will make me pretty satisfied, and i will be able to lead a happy life with the career opportunities that follow."
i just need a physics book for dummies.
i am here because i am interested in how the universe operates.
i have to do both physics 111112 and 121122.
i am taking physics 112 because it is one of the required concentration courses for my major.
"i want to do more than exist, i want to be happy and i want to have purpose."
i find it really hard to retain information during the lecture because its so much information to receive in such a short amount of time.
i think that the concepts behind how motion works is very fascintating.
i have previously taken a sci 115 course and it heavily contributed to bettering my study habits.
i sure hope being in college can be the right direction for me instead of being a waste of time and money to where i worked so dearly hard to be at.
often times i struggle with taking tests so i am hopeful that this semester will take a positive turn from visualizing my work.
i struggle in day to day life and classes because of the grief.
for each one i always end up saying so that i dont miss class and can graduate.
the third reason why i am here is my dream to go to new york.
"also, it helps me to recognize how much i really understand or not."
"it was really a no brainer for me from the start, and i knew that i would be taking this class over a biology lab."
"despite the fact that i need this class for my major (biology), i am at college because i hope to learn both inside and outside of the classroom as well as ideally apply what i learn in school to the real world."
i am taking this class because i havent passed calculus 1 is one of the reasons and i took physics in high school but it was a long time ago soi need this class in order to refresh my memory about topics that i have forgotten.
not only for these reasons.
"i am here for many reasons: make myself proud happy getting education is a priveledge, knowledge is power!"
at times i feel like these classes are not relevant but have come to learn to have an open mindset because you never know if you'll find another internet and passion that otherwise you would have missed out on.
i signed up for this class in hopes that i would get a bit more practice and help figuring out the problems that i couldn't figure out last semester.
"id want to teach kids how to program, code, and how to think because technology is going to be everywhere."
i am here in lab class to get a better understanding of my physics lecture classes.
i lack the motivation that i once had because college is stressful.
i heard many things about physics and the most thing i heard was that it is very hard and complex.
"although this class is truly a general ed required for me to graduate, i chose it because i love this subject."
i have already used the knowledge of my peers in this sci class to solve a problem i was not familiar with.
"(i dont yet know which)i am also looking into pa, which i just became aware of through other classes ive taken the summer."
could even end up just maxing out in units for the next two years.
we help and teach each other the material and thats what i like about it.
i am here because you can never have too much help.
"i one took a physics class back in mexico and i actually like it, because it basically explains every movement but with numbers, making it an exact replication rather than just words or imagination."
"my major is biochemistry, and this is a requirement for my class."
"i joined this class with the purpose of it helping me in furthering my knowledge of chem since my main chem 180 class is just to short off a lecture, just being 50 min."
i dont regret joining sci 115 because it has helped me a lot and it has helped me learn new learning techniques that i wouldnt learn on my own and has helped me to learn new ways to study and to learn and how to do chemistry over all.
i believe that i am here because im a biochemistry major and this class is one of my requirements and i believe that this class will help me and give me the tools and a different perspective of things as i go on further into my studies in the chemical aspect.
"this class can teach you how to work with others, which i think is a critical skill to learn."
"why am i here?i am here because i have to fulfill a major requirement, and i also want to get the knowledge needed to go further into my major."
before signing up for this class i never thought that sci classes were a big help.
it is my 5th year here and hopefully by the end of 2021 i will have completed all my required classes for civil engineering.
no one has the same purpose in life.
and so it just happens to be the case that i am here that's my answer to the why.
it is a discipline that studies the laws of nature.
"this included online banking, bill pay, mobile deposit, and more."
"right now i feel it was a good decision, helped me understand new topics and more problems to practice with."
i chose to come up here because i've always wanted to come to the bay area since in my opinion is a beautiful city.
i am here in this physics lab so i can fulfill a requirement for my major in biology and move one step closer to getting a degree in biology.
"by being in that class, i'm surrounded by my peers i can learn and reiterate the material in my brain."
i know that physics 102 is suppose to make your understanding of physics 101 a lot clearer and easier to learn.
when deciding on what school to transfer too i remembered how much i love the atmosphere of sfsu and of the city.
"i made the mistake of not taking a sci class when i was in calculus, and my grades suffered from it."
"i chose to major in computer science because i love computers and also, im interested in technology."
"after working minimum wage part time jobs while in community college, i've learned that there is no way i can do that for the rest of my life."
"i am also excited to start using math to learn physics, because it is a subject that i have begun to understand and appreciate much more."
i was originally a general biology major.
we learn everyday even without the intention to do so.
"to better understand what compounds these molecules can make, i decided to take sci. since the class is taught by students who took organic chemistry, they know what the professors are looking for and how to approach certain questions."
"i dont know exactly, i dont think i am here for any specific reason that i know of."
i can possibly minor or double major in economics if i feel like taking a few extra courses but have not decided.
i love everything that is related to math and can be calculated.
i don't think i'd take this class if it wasn't.
i will probably have to memorize a lot of formulas and make sure i dont slip up on my math.
"well, to start off, i found this question pretty vague, which i'm assuming is the point of this question."
the reason why i want to go into the stem field is because engineering intrigues me.
with other people's work you see what that made in which science denies.
i would like to get an a in o chem 2 because i struggled with o chem 1.
"before i came to the us, my liberal arts scores was alway floating on the pass line, but my science scores like chemistry and physics scores are always over 140 out of 150."
"it took me a year after high school to get here, and i wasn't going to do anything else."
"if i am not mistaken, all science class have a lab that comes with the lecture which is why i am taking this course, and it will be like this in the future for more science classes i will be taking."
i do believe there are worlds among us and perhaps other life in space.
"learning physics is helpful to not only me but to all because it answers the basic fundamental question of how this world works, or of its appearances and natural disasters, etc."
"im hoping this time around, it will work out for me."
also i just really want to invent something that will benefit society one day but in reality i just want to design and recreate something out of scratch and build it better.
"i tend to learn better when the class sizes are smaller and more interactive compared to the stuffed lecture classes so by working in groups, we can learn from each other."
"i would love to work in a lab and be able to look at samples (tissues, blood, urine, etc.) in the microscope and tell whether someone has cancer, aids, etc."
i have never taken physics before mostly because i am intimidated by the math in it.
"in getting a good grade and being here regularly, this increases my chances of doing well and being successful in the real world by developing good work ethic and study habits."
the reason why i am here is because ive heard chemistry is hard and it intimidates me.
"however, speaking in more broad terms why am i here at this school, san francisco state, well that is because i am trying to earn a degree in biology, and hopefully have a wellpaying job in the future, as to why most people go to college."
karla martinez why i am here?
"specifically for this class, this is a prerequisite for my major, and it is a mandatory class to take with phys 0220. however, for the following 3 semesters, i will be trying to pursue music while taking ge courses for my major."
i am glad i chose to attend school here.
also i know that being any type of engineer is required to understand majority of physics and know how to do calculations in order for myself to become an engineering field specialist.
another reason why i am here is to aim for the best grade i deserve while still understanding the topic instead of copying off someone else or online.
"i hope that through the sci course, i bring my grade in the parent class up to an a. with a strong foundation in physics, i can also hope to be a better physician in the future as i will have a more developed understanding of motion and how the body moves."
"i tried to take phys111 last sem, but i couldnt keep up with professor xu and had to drop out."
"i think it was the second day of physics 111 class of this semester, facilitator 1 came to our class and explained about sci 111 class, in which i had a good impression of the class."
"finally, i believe that the process of getting a degree is really an exercise in gaining knowledge that can be applied in the future to change my beliefs."
i self motivate and try my best to encourage others to learn and understand the importance of concepts so they in turn will do the same.
its interesting that there are so many things i do in everyday life that relates to physics and i never realized these little things until now.
once i am done with school i hope to help with research on coastal fish species like salmon and steelhead to help conserve and restore the wild populations we have observed before.
"also, if i do skip class it will just snowball and cause me to skip more classes."
"though it is difficult, it is certainly going to pay off."
"feeding bad habits starting in middle school through high school, deciding to postpone getting a degree after highschool since i didnt have real academic interests, choosing to start in community college to do general education classes."
i am currently a kinesiology major that recently switched from prenursing.
my dad worked for the mill so we lived in that town of less than one thousand people.
my purpose is to succeed in this class and to take my knowledge and apply it to everything in my daily life.
it was just ok.
"so for me, that would allow me to be part of the workforce and be able to find a job in this area."
"this class, will help me strive and understand concepts that my professor has taught me during the week."
i also think that having a bit of knowledge in chem or physics its more interesting than what everyone else is doing just math.
i expect my professors in both lab and lecture and able to be prepared before the actual class and i also expect them to grade everyone with the equality and fairness.
"going off of that, when i do well in certain courses, i find more interest in that subject and want to continue doing well in that area."
"it's been a while since i've taken calc, but i am going to try my best."
"in all honesty, this is the second time that i am taking ochem, so i want to make sure i pass this time."
"yet, these concepts will be an important part of my work i will be doing in the future."
"so ill be able to get on with my future life goals, and succeed for my purpose in my life."
i feel that the world of science called to me a couple of years back.
physic 111 and physic 112 are my first ever actual physic class.
unfortunately it is a requirement for biology major students.
i have taken some other classes in my previous years of education and i surely can say this one is the most interesting one.
"information such as gravity, pressure, and volume from learning physics and their laws help with understanding the body."
i will have the opportunity to have the extra practice with physics problems without the stress of having to worry about my grade.
taking this class allows me to see the equations that we see in class to solve problems put into real world uses and allows me to further understand the equations and reasons that these equations exist.
"currently im interested in mobile app development, but if that interest ever changes then ill have a lot of skills still applicable to other types of work within the stem field (at least, other types of programming work)."
"i'm hoping that i'll find a reason to stay in the science field, because i dont really know what else to do."
"when this semester began, i quickly realized that it was quite the opposite."
jordaan render phys 102 reflection 1 why am i here?
i am also here because i just finished taking calculus 1 last semester and i wanted to take calculus first before i took physics so that way i wouldnt be lost.
i am here because i want to be.
i love the fact that physics breaks down the every day forces that we take for granted every day.
"with the area of biomechanics, i will be able to understand how the body works and how to improve our movements to prevent injuries."
"i am in this specific class to help my understanding of physics, because i find physics interesting."
"i especially felt very alone when my roommate, who had quickly become my best friend, had to leave school midway through the year during my freshman year."
"overall, i am in sci to extend my knowledge in physics, meet new people, and learn in a fun way."
there are whole other worlds out there and i feel so small just on this one.
it deffenitly keeps my brain working by asking myself and thinking for the real true reason why one must be in any class.
i want to make a decent living and without school id have to do that though something like labor working.
this sounds like a knock on the class but it's more about what i would get from this class and if i would use it in the future vs taking a class on something like machine learning and using that in the future.
"i am here to absorb new material, make mistakes, and learn from those mistakes."
"it is a little hard to see how physics is related to cell biology, but when trying to relate it to molecular biology the connection becomes a little clearer."
ender's gameis a 1985military science fictionnovel by american authororson scott card.
i took a physics class durign high shcool and i found the labs to be very helpful.
"seeing as my courses are only getting harder and my outside responsibilities are only growing in numbers and in time commitment, i figured that being proactive in my learning was going to be critical this semester."
"all in all, i am here because physics is a requirement for me, but it doesnt change the fact that this is fun class to take."
why am i at san francisco state university?
i like having a lot of options because i do not like having to chose between two things as it tends to be unfair.
"as for the second reason, i could have not come to class today, but i am here because this class is only once a week and it's quite interesting."
"i was born in the city, grew up ion the city, and now living my early adulthood in the city."
"im a 5th year here at sfsu, majoring in kinesiology and minoring in anthropology!"
i am here to soak up as much one on one interaction as possible in the department of physics.
i enjoy going to the gym which is why im a kinesiology major.
i also needed the extra unit that this class provides so it was a win win scenario for me.
i am in this city because i go to this school (a little obvious haha).
"i constantly question my purpose, but also am reminded of my purpose."
i learn best when i am in a class setting working with other students and peers.
i didn't really study with anyone for the first exam but i think i'll be able to for the second exam.
i hope this sci class helps me to know more about what im learning and helps me study more efficiently with all the practice problems they give me.
it has been my dream ever since i was eight years old.
i am trying to major in electrical engineering.
why am i attending san francisco state university?
this will help people come up and generate new ideas when working on a certain task.
zoom and other similar platforms are able to bring people together from all over the world.
i am here because part of reaching that dream is not only to follow steps without learning from them.
"so far i'm definitely trying my best and i'm doing okay in schoolwork life, home life not so much but things happen, i'll get through it."
"i believe i am here to spark change, be a spark of something that should have been present long ago."
"but i really dont know what to do after college, what i should major in, and what job i would want."
this is why i am here and i look forward to meeting all these goals and it has been a blessing to be where i am now.
i personally think everyone should take physics to learn more about how things work and why they work like that.
"because honestly, i wouldn't be here if it wasn't for them."
i believe i am definitely here for a reason.
but i'm hoping that this class will change my mind about how i feel about physics and so far i am enjoying this class.
i chose to come to san francisco state university because my friend attended school here and recommended me to try it.
i am here because i am going to learn about physics and why it exists.
"so far, i like everything about it and i dont regret my decision."
"there will be many obstacles, especially during this time with all the stu going in the world today but with grit and growth mindsets, we all can persevere and get through it."
"so many of these courses were humanities and just consisted of reading and writing, read this book and write this essay etc."
this makes me worried about passing the class with good grade.
i guess i want my life to be exciting and fun.
but currently right now i found another purpose of my years here.
"aside from that, i am also here to further my education not just to get my degree but to also help me better my understand of the world."
"i would also love working as a park ranger and protect our national parks which sometimes get disturbed by us humans by leaving trash, not being cautious with fires and more."
i am here because i am.
the reason i chose to go into the stem field is because i have always liked learning.
to be completely honest if i had a choice i would have probably not been taking the class only because of physics in one of those subjects that i would not mind not taking.
i have enjoyed this university thus far because i feel as if every teacher is doing their best to help us pass.
"as a freshman, i contemplated whether or not i should choose a concentration."
i never took this class in high or middle school.
"at 28 years old, i have came across several roadblocks that has directed me to quick."
the only cool places i have been are hawaii and new orleans.
i am excited to be able to see the world in a different way through the eyes of physics.
"i am student name, major in mechanical engineering, transferred to sf state from a southern california community college."
this class help me in math 227.
my weakest link is definitely my running backs but they will come around this week.
this is why i am here at the university and why i am here in this class.
i am in college to further my education.
"for this course, i expect to be able to relate the theory that i learn in 230 and be able to understand it in practical terms."
i am here in this particularly coarse because it is a prerequisite for other classes and necessary to obtain my degree.
this is the case with science for me.
so this is why i am here at sfsu majoring in civil engineer.
i wish to improve my math skills and conversion skills.
but again after a year of that i realized i wanted to do even more.
i always excelled in the life sciences and their connection to the real world always seemed to grasp my attention.
i had to compete in order to make it to the egg and outcompete millions of other sperm cells in order for me to be able to make it to the egg and to be then developed and then born.
i picked up photography from my dad when i was little and have been taking photos ever sinceits my way of journaling and i find it very therapeutic.
"solving problems and just all about calculating numbers, but after taking my first semester of physics, i realized that physics is a combination of science and math."
i also decided to attend classes at sf state because i was born and raised here and i went to high school right next to state at lowell high school and wanted to stay somewhere in the city or near the city to save money and also stay close to my family.
"when going to even broader terms why am i here on earth, well one could say it was simply because my parents got together and from there i was born?"
and it certainly beats taking any kinda of lower or upper division ge in terms of interesting material.
"what i'm planning to learn in this class is how things move and to be able to apply it to the real world, a.k.a., driving a car or a plane flying."
"i do want to succeed, but i am not afraid to fail either as long as i can find one thing of any size to show i learned something and what to do for the next time."
"why am i here?when i think about why i'm here, i think about my goals."
"not only that i am taking this class to fulfill my requirement, i am also here to learn so i can adapt this skill in case i will use it again in the future."
i took physics in high school and i enjoyed the projects weve done.
it was the time that the bank transitioned its sales to be from products and services to only convenience services.
"i have heard that physics better your skills of reasoning and i think by taking this class, my skills of problemsolving and reasoning will improve."
we also learned what the law states and mean and did science experiments based on them.
my knowledge on the subject of physics other than the basics is kind of abysmal and my knowledge when it comes to electricity and magnetism is pretty bad.
so far i've been having a great semester for the first time in a long time i finally dont feel like im behind in all my classes.
i'm often asked by my friends why i have to calculus and physics courses.
the question 'why am i here?' is a little more complex than it is.
united states has been my dream to go because of the land of opportunity.
i am here in this classroom because i must receive a grade that will determine whether or not i will be proceeding to the next class.
i dont necessarily care for physics but it is interesting to learn about and especially being able to understand it but i can also live without knowing too much about it.
i just really want to make a big impact and leave my mark.
"for example, there is a lot of physics involved in ocean currents and how water is moved around the world."
i feel like the weekly quizzes were ineffective because my seminar section was before my lecture so the material on the quiz especially during the end of the semester hadn't been properly covered.
im fascinated by moviestv shows.
i intend of understanding more of this course that really puzzles me.
i mainly need to focus on the formulas that are used and my problem solving skills.
"i always knew i was to go to college, but i wasnt sure for what."
i took it in highschool and i think that makes it easier for me to conceptualise the concepts.
"now im thinking that i am here because i just want to learn more about the subject and how i can apply this to real life, as well as my major."
there are things that i learned in chemistry that i have seen in physics.
"it is apart of my identity, and it allows me to connect with a piece the piece of humanity i thought i had once lost."
this is not really the case for any of my other classes.
i can calculate the distance it takes from the house to the bart station.
"i'm no philosopher but i think physics might help to make sense of that thought because it is, after all, the study of the laws of nature."
the idea that health is more important by living a more active lifestyle.
i also think its important to take physics because what we learn is very valuable to the world around us.
"if we can reduce how much we use, then how much waste we produce is also cut down."
"in all reasons, i am sure that many things happen for a reason, at divine alignment (when you let things flow in the universe).given that physics 112 is a undergraduate prerequisite to my intended m.d. program of study, i am required to be in this course."
i hope to continue my long but heartfelt journey so that i can have a career and a life that i am proud of.
"still, i had a very annoying experience in high school with physics."
i am here in sci305 because i did not understand many concepts from 305 when i took it.
i am already seeing similarities from physics 111 and 112.
i am in physics 112 becasue it is a corequisite for physics 111.
"honestly, if it wasn't required i probably wouldn't be in this class."
"someone is going to pay well to create something, and it is pretty fun to be able to come up with an idea to a problem that someone has and be able to take that idea and create something tangible from it."
"personally, i decided to search for a stem related major, because i feel like it will align with my interests and hobbies, and lead to me finding a job that i can be happy and proud about."
i am here because this class is a requirement for my major (civil engineering).
"in the fall of 2017 when i first began my studies here, i was only taking electives and calculus i as a math class."
ive taken physics 2a equivalent to physics 111 in city college and the professor explained most of the concepts clearly.
as something i tend to study materials that is not even in the exam.
i have so much to study for physics 111 even though the school semester just started.
now that's something scientists are still uncovering everyday and i think it's really neat to be able to see these discoveries which raise even further questions at times.
i went to college so i get an education about the things that i will need for my future careers inside of the business field.
however i did need a lab and a physical science for me ge's and i instantly thought of physics when i learned that.
"if everyone came together, learned about each other and have an open mind, the world would be in a better place.i, myself can't do much as a person at the moment, but my goal in life is to be in a position, where i can make a change and be an example to others."
i think this stems from me not really grasping the idea of physics.
i have been around my home for almost two decades and i wanted to reinvent myself.
"for me, the biology sci 230 class was very effective because it actually helped me understand and think more in depth about the content i learned."
i believe the original idea was just to get my ge's and this lab sounded interesting as well as the introduction to astronomy lab.
"i also really like and enjoy doing math, therefore i wanted to choose a major which included this subject."
"in a different and more general sense of why i am here, well, i know that i am here because i have given this gift of life and i try my best to make the best of it everyday."
im really hoping to make more of those connections this semester.
physics in particular seems like a great way to conceptualize the world and understand how different types of motions respond to one another.
i am here in my bedroom doing physics because of the new corona virus.
"everything we have been learning has been aligning with what im learning in my astronomy lecture, which helps so im never really too confused."
i hope to see you soon one day.sincerelykrystopher
i like to learn about physics because it has to do more about related to math.
"i am also here because the formula to being successful is getting knowledge to do better, be better and to reinvent."
"even though some classes can be very difficult, they make learning fun and interesting."
"also, i love science, and since physics is a science course, i wanted to take it."
i am here because chemistry is a really challenging subject and i need all the extra help i can get.
i am better at learning subjects that are around real world problems and where you can work hands on and actually see what you are dealing with.
i'm not sure if this response answers the question but to be real i have been trying to answer that question within me for a while now and all i can say is that i still searching for that answer.....but i'm not sur if i'll ever truly find it.
"going into this course i feel uncertain about how well i will do, since the last time i took this class was in high school."
labs are also a good way to take all the equations that weve learned and to put them to use on a lab project which allows us to see how each equation relates to one another and the importance of each equation in their uses.
"i feel by enrolling in this class, i am making the most of the opportunities and resources available to me."
"kimberly ramirez 21020 people have always said that when it comes to goals and dreams, it's about the journey, not the destination."
"by being given this opportunity to go to school, my goal is to be the best person i can be."
i am in this class because it is one of the prerequisites to get into the later classes of engineering.
why am i here taking a sci class?
i am here because i chose this lab.
i wanted to try to grow on my own away from home and my family.
i will have to find a way to challenge myself.
i know when something is wrong or right.
i have had to write many why am i here paragraphs.
i wanted to try something different and i went for it.
this class helps get me to my end goal.
another big reason for enrolling was when i heard i wouldnt have homework.
"all through elementary school and up in to high school, i tried my best in everything to get where i am today."
if ever need be we can rest assure that scientists are actively studying these plants so that we ever must evacuate are world we have a chance to call another place our home.
i understand the concepts and i get why we have to learn physics.
it took me a little while to figure out what i wanted to do in general and i finally was able to sit down and figure out what i wanted.
"also, because i like learning topics with activity, so it can help me more."
it's easy to be stagnant and get comfortable with our routine.
"but as the weeks go on i've started to realize why i ""keep"" being here, and it's because i actually enjoy learning about this stuff."
"the reason i am here (this class phys112) is because it is a requirement for my planned major, in earth and climate science."
"i also want to have a chance to work closer with my classmates as a team, to make friends and to learn from each other."
you might think physic is not relevant to research and business but they are connected.
it would be wonderful if i can learn to love physics after taking his course.
"i also have to learn skills that might apply to future class i will be taking in the future , particularly in my future science courses ."
i was in the same boat last year when i took piano as a ge art requirement.
it is just that i don't really like hard sciences as much.
i am incredibly thankful for all they've done for me.
i have to compare with 1.4 billion people and to survive i have to put two hundred percent of hard work.
"my major is computer science and once graduating, i want hope to find a job with a big tech company."
"and so i decided i would pursue a technical field, a choice i am grateful for."
i don't know something like that.
the reason i am here is because this is one of the schools that accepted me and it was more economically convenient to come to this school.
"in this field, i think that there are many interesting things could happened."
"the reason i decided to join this is because i figured that it would be helpful throughout the semester because, even though i am a physics major, i kind of suck at math (lol.) i really believe that this class will help me improve my skills and maybe even help me understand the new concepts more concretely."
we play games and teach each other.
"so, that is what i am doing, i am getting school done with early so that later on itll be easier to have a family and could already have a creeer and be set that way."
"so, in this case, there must be very valuable concepts in physics that apply to environmental science."
a good life being objective as good isnt the same for everyone.
i am hoping that i will be able to full grasp the material so that i won't have to look back on my college days and wished that i had put in more effort or tried harder.
i came here to pursue my goals of becoming a doctor of some sort.
movies like the martian or avatar or any other science fiction film filled my mind with wonder about what was out there in the universe.
"when i ask why am i here i don't wonder what i am i doing in this particular location, no matter how sketchy it is, but i wonder what brought me to the bay area."
biologyscience has always been my passion.
"i am able to build off more on their ideas, or even come up with my own way by taking different ways on how to studytake notes for class."
"additionally, this is my second year taking a sci class."
"i did not feel like i struggled in chem 115, which is why i did not take the si course with it last semester."
"even though physics it not necessarily part of my biology major, i do believe it explains a lot of what happens in the universe."
"furthermore, this lab will definitely help in future thinking, i mean do something research and boost on building more deeper concepts and carry the invention level at higher spot."
i have taken online classes before but they were nothing like how they are now.
"anyone who intends to do any kind of technical work needs to understand the fundamentals of physics, and thus the fundamentals on which our modern, hightech society depends."
"since you opened up late work until may 16th, i realized i could go back and finally submit this consciousness assignment.)"
there were so many books to choose from that i just couldnt bring myself to pick one.
"not just because the class was really easy, but also because the subject matter is always something of interest for me."
"we can learn more about mechanics in physics and how it applies to everyday life, like in our machinery and other stuff."
"more specifically, im in this class because i needed a lab credit and astronomy seemed to be the lab id be able to not do the worst in."
i'm here because i know we all have something to learn.
i have recently declared my major in biology with the physiology concentration.
"the amount of money, houses, beauty one has cannot compare to the stars in the sky."
this is my second time taking physics.
why am i here?this is a really deep question.
"therefore, i was expecting that if there would be a supplemental class for that, i really should take the class."
well to start off i'm here because obviously my parents made me.
this class is also a requirement for my biology degree.
i think every single person in my life has had an impact on me as well.
"i hope one day i get to create new, clean technologies that not only benefit the general population, but the environment we live in as well."
"i am not exactly sure what you do in a physics lab class, especially one that is online, but i am hoping to have some fun with what we learn in class and maybe doing some ""experiments"" every once and awhile."
"i do not know much about physics because i did not have a great teacher in high school, so i lack a little in an understanding."
"i am not sure what specific aspect are we suppose to talk about whether it is personal, or about the class but there are a couple of reasons of why i am here."
"i have wilson at quarterback and at wr i have adams, jones and cooks."
"""why am i here"" is quite the openended question, and so for my answer i will choose to answer specifically."
i remember having a tough time understanding the concepts even though i attended supplemental instruction (they called it si) from a past student.
"i am at san francisco state university, because i heard about the great biology program here and it is not that far from home."
that is why im here.
im actually not sure why im here.
i was raised thinking that life was only about working and that was the only way that i was going to be able to navigate through life was through work.
"to be frank, i am not very interested in physics but i hope that changes by the end of the semester."
i almost attended a city college after graduating high school but my mom preferred me to attend school elsewhere.
i am worried about getting bored.
"to make a better future for myself and ultimately the world, as cheesy as that sounds."
some people argue that we are all here for a purpose and some say were here by chance.
"i feel like the lecture course can be confusing at times, so i believe the sci course will help with clarifying those confusions."
i am here because i believe this class with give me help and understanding to succeed and move on to other chemistry classes.
i'm here because i have a dream and i will accomplish it.
the more college passes by the more i think i just want to minor in engineering and major in economics or something else.
"though, i am really bad with physics, math and chemistry."
"while that is true, i also think it's important for me to recognize that this class will not only fulfill a requirement on paper, but also allow me to draw connections to my other science and math courses."
i would like to widen my knowledge of the branches of physics and to come across how it reflects to our universe.
"i grew up in china, the high school there requires students to learn physics as well."
"furthermore, you have to be in the 232 class while enrolled in lecture 230 or else you will be kicked out."
i was always fascinated by how everything works and having my uncle also be an engineer gave me lots of exposure to the field.
"i do not have a strong background in mathematics; despite being given formulas i have a difficult time understanding the ultimate purpose of the formula, as in what it is meant to prove, and i end up getting confused and frustrated with the material."
it is my weakness in school.
having guest speakers has been easier.
one of the main reasons is that i am heavily influenced by my role models.
"i want to be active all of my life, so i love a job that keeps me moving."
"although these things already make sense to a non science major, it is still valuable to learn this information and to know when to use it when necessary."
i am very curious about our universe and the various things that inhabit it.
i enjoy working with computers and programming.
but i also want to learn to recognize methods in solving issues.
more specifically civil engineering intrigues me.
"however, at the end of my senior year i started to doubt myself and what i wanted to do with my life, so i turned down three scholarship offers in canada and decided to stay local (here at sfsu) as an undeclared student."
i am enrolled for physics 122 mainly to fulfill my graduation requirements for my biology degree.
the idea of money is all in our heads.
we can form study groups and prepare for the next advance physics class.
i began to look deeper into the background of his job and fell upon computer science.
"in conclusion, i am apart of sci 230 to get the help i need in order to pass bio 230 and meet new people who are also taking the course."
"when being asked why am i here, a lot runs through my mind."
i am here in this physics 112 laboratory class because i currently taking physics 111 lecture.
"i believe that you must be challenged in different ways in order to grow in life, and with organic chemistry, it challenges you in all the different ways."
i would choose to answer in the way of why am i here in this class.
i also must reveiw the assigments in order to understand the material and it will help me in passing my physics lecture course.
i was really nervous coming into physics because i didnt know anything.
"i also work better with smaller groups, which isnt something i can get in a large lecture class like chem 335."
"i am sorry for my unrespect in my last semester phys 222 lab, but because of the thought that no need, i didn't want to spend time on something i already know."
i have never taken a physics course so this has all been pretty new to me.
my major is computer science and learning physics is a good way to learn how to problem solve.
"i am also here because i needed a tuesday and thursday lab class, i dont have space during my monday, wednesday or friday session because my schedules already packed."
why did i choose to come at 6:00 p.m. and spend the night working onthe lab until 8:00 p.m. instead of doing homework and relaxing?
"i usually ask myself that question, the purpose of my existence, the decisions i make and the responsibilities i have to do."
i plan to transfer to uc berkeley with this as one of my classes.
"but despite all the requirements, i also have passion and wondered about how physics works."
i am very appriciative of this class.
i only took astronomy last semester and can have a difficult time remembering most of the class's work and lecture.
this class gives me a chance to refine what i am currently learning and helps me visually understand many of the concepts that may be more difficult to comprehend.
i think that problem solving goes beyond doing physics problems or math problems.
classes done in about one year of university.
i enjoyed learning about computers and the basics of coding.
"hi my name is landrew wilford, i'm a stem major or more specifically im a mechanical engineering major."
i have trouble sharing or asking my questions in the bio seminar because the class is so big so i feel intimidated at times.
and they are essential to one's academic success.
i am here because even though its one of my prerequisites for my major degree i would like to learn more about physics and enjoy the subject.
i look forward to this semester.
physics to me is the study of how things move and how things interact with each other such as gravity and forces.
"before starting my freshman year two years ago, i was applying to schools for architecture and for computer science."
i could be at bed right now or taking a hike or going to the gym or even better walking my dog at fort funston.
i am confident that sci 321 will give me the needed practice and help me excel in chem 321.
"instead, i see change come with technology."
i decided to come to sf state because my sister went here about 8 years ago and she told me what a great school it is.
"turns out that, that class also did not count for my lower division ges so here i am taking astronomy lab."
i am presently in thornton hall room 116.
i feel hopeful in my tiny place.
now i struggle with o chem 2 because i don't knowremember anything from o chem 1.
i like that i have time to review topics i did not understand in class and ask not only the tutors but peers as well.
i came to sf state because it was closer to home and it was going to save me a lot of money.
"for example, cell phones work based on the principle of electricity and the electromagnetic spectrum."
ever since i came to san francisco state i constantly ask myself this question.
the reason for taking sci is that i may be able to understand the concepts of physics and the subject itself to the best of my abilities.
i am here at san francisco state university to prepare myself for the future.
my prior experience during my high school was never boring.
it is my first day here because i have been temporarily assigned to this class.
"i cannot afford to fall behind, especially in my biology classes so i have to take all the precautions necessary to keep that from ever happening."
"i suppose there is no real or ""good"" reason for why i am here."
i ended up just giving up on passing the class.
"and going to college is optional for those kind of job, as the employers values coding experience and projects over a degree."
its interesting to know how other planets are different than earth.
"originally, i wanted to go into the stem field because i grew up in a workshop working with my hands so i thought i wanted to learn the physics and science behind it all."
however it wasnt until high school i learned that i would to make a living off science.
physics helps me get out of the memorization zone and get into a more logical zone.
"it is for sure going to help with my critical thinking and problem solving, whether it is for math or solving a real life problem."
"computer science has brought me to this course, while i am generally pretty unfamiliar with how physics works in our daily lives, i am at least curious to see it calculated and derived throughout actions i do daily.i hope to be able to take away material from this course as i would any other cs course, regardless of my selected major."
i am here because i have always wanted to see what physics was about.
i haven't taken a physics class since high school but i do remember some things like the types of energy and transfer of them.
"directly i am here, writing this response in physics lab, because this is a course required for my degree and i am receiving credit for writing this."
but everything has changed when my grandpa passed away in my senior year.
this sci course will hopefully make me feel comfortable in future science course and perhaps i will gain studying or academic skills i will use in the following years.
i do enjoy learning more about science in general.
"why am i here?in the sense where we are talking about why am i here, right now in the lab room, i am here because i am taking a course further complete my major and hopefully graduate on time."
in terms of physics i never took this kind of class until i was in college.
"initially, i did not want to go here."
"but i also like the vibe of this city, its much different as opposed to the other cities nearby."
"it is high time to reconsider how to make questions because ai is developing, and it will replace our jobs with automation."
"when i am around my peers in that classroom, i sense a connection and i know that they want what i want, which is to understand physics and pass the class with a good grade."
i believe that biology is one of the major subjects someone needs to understand if you work in the medical field.
im just letting life flow and wherever it takes me is where ill be.
i believe that by attending san francisco state university i have decided to attend here.
there isnt much to say other than the fact that i wish life were kind of different and i am sure that many others feel the same way.
the subject is useful to many car makers and pretty much everything in our lives.
you need to get a degree to get where you want to go.
"to me, this is my first step into becoming financially independent, since having a degree helps with getting a good job, although in my field, it would mostly be freelancing opportunities."
"i am currently at sf state, in the beautiful city of san francisco."
i want to take full advantage of this course and try hard in order to really understand the material and pass my actual calc class.
"in previous courses in this subject, i have not necessarily struggled but have had to work hard to do well."
i was nervous for the lab at first because i had no idea what kind of labs we would do or what they would consist of.
"i am required to take physics with calculus 1, along with its lab portion concurrently."
i am someone who is very curious and has always asked questions.
i am here because i wanted to take on an astronomy minor since i love learning about the planets and stars of our universe.
i am here because i always wanted to be involved in the stem field ever since i have been a little kid.
also every time ive went to get the lab manual it was difficult they are always closed.
this is the reason why i am here so that i can acheive my goals and what i am passionate about.
the homework we are assigned has problems that are tough for me.
"like its what i am here to do, why i'm here, if you will."
this lab course is a concurrent enrollment course to the phy112 course.
kind of like living life to the fullest and having no regrets.
"i heard and seen that the science department is really good, sfsu is known for their science classes so i thought it would be good for me to start my career."
one of the main reasons i am here is to get an education.
why sf i ask myself that question a lot but it is a very vibrant diverse city.
i thought everything was lost.
i hope i am able to repeat the lab or a lab similar because it was the one i enjoyed the most.
"learning something new, as i will in this course, is a step in the right direction."
"this isn't to sayi wasn't interested in engineering, but there was a lack of confidence in my academic abilities."
i also am interested in how eveything works through classical mechanics and think it is entertaining to toy around with the concepts.
"im not bad per say, but im just worse at it than i am with other classes."
"now that i am in this course, i am happy to attend a class that helps me understand the concepts of psychics."
shes someone who highly supports me getting a college education and she is one of the reasons i continue to push myself even when things get difficult.
"is also to understand the dimensions of time, and space."
"i really love this book which is why i chose it, i hope you read it."
but i am here because this is the life the world believes is the path to a life without struggle and without hardship.
"physics gives us powerful tools to help us to express our creativity, to see the world in new ways and then to change it."
"one day, a friend approached me about joining a construction trade."
"the teachers here are very nice and caring, so learning from them is a privilege."
"the main reason on why i or other student want ot go into stem fields are that the science, technology, engineering and mathematics all the fields are much important in every type of career and its perceived in every part of our life, having knowledge in these area is helpful for every student in pursuing jobs thus it motivate them and me to develop more passion for it to be more success in these areas."
i used to actually brush off the idea of doing anything related to physics because i always thought of it as a confusing concept about how things move or happen.
or because we enjoy this?
on top of that i'm an ra as well so that's always stressful.
"that way i think that the future is riding on me, so id better do my best."
i am honestly excited to get started and learn new things in this lab.
"iroronically, it is a arbritary number."
to be honest i am really just taking this class to graduate and its been a couple of years at least since i took my astronomy class so remembering all of that info has been alittle hard.
"the school is a good size, and has a lot of amazing buildings."
my regiment pushes south at dawn.
that is not to say that i am disinterested in physics.
"i like learning, studying, thinking, doing , and participating to job work."
physics is one of the hardest sciences courses i will be taking and should be fun.
i just find it to be an interesting subject that we could apply everywhere else.
why am i here?my journey into physics started with my interest in computers.
"whether it be good or bad, the influence it gave me, made me a better person today."
"finally, after the last semester sci 220, i found it to be super fun."
"i'm a biology major, and learning about other sciences such as physics and chemistry are really beneficial."
this gives me the understanding that ill need should i decide to pursue further physics knowledge and give me the concepts that ill need to know for my major.
i can only hope to be half the people they were.
i am here in this class to learn more about physics in a physical way rather than in pure equations and numbers.
i believe i am in san francisco for many reasons.
i am taking this class because i am also in physics lecture and intriguing and it seemed interesting.
"i believe in my case because i want to work with sharks, physics will play a large part when it comes to the sharks ability to sense living things due to their electroreceptors."
i am from sacramento and i am here on the bay because of my focus and motivations and refusal of disruptions and deterring of my focus.
"like i dont know there a lot of different reasons why i am here, some that i know about and probably some i dont know about."
the application to real life may help me understand how certain things turn out to be.
there is a lot physics involved with waves and how they form.
if i hadnt taken one specic class in high school by chance then i would not be pursuing the career i am right now.
"i wouldnt say im the most inclined towards physics, but i understand its usefulness in learning the concepts it encompasses."
"i expect this supplementary course to give me a chance to build on what i have learned in the lectures from chemistry 321, and i hope it gives me the opportunity to ask questions about things im not sure about from the chemistry 321 lectures."
i enjoy the challenge for solve problems that people have trouble with.
but this class will help me learn about the introduction of electricity and magnetism.
"i also just generally enjoy science, though it can be difficult at times."
having to take this class expands our horizons to how the world works today.
this will only benefit me in the end because i will be able to apply physics outside of class.
i am here in this lab class because this physics course is a requirement for my major biology.
the reason why i am taking general physics i lab is because it is one of the requirements for my major.
it is pretty confusing and does not come easy to me.
"well, there are a few reasons, i guess."
i am here to help others in life whether thatd be through my job or outside of it.
"with enough studying, i can most likely make it through physics without struggling too much."
i enjoy being able to see the direct correlation between what i was taught and how it affects the world that i live in.
"i am very happy to be here, you seem so sweet and smart."
"here at sfsu we get to focus a lot more on the stars, planets, go more in depth about earth, the sun, the moon and its phases."
"i also haven't learned any physics since 8th grade and didn't have a great teacher then, and since science is my favorite subject to study and math coming in second, i look forward to learning more about the branch of science that i know the least about."
"i was cared to ""start over"" in a sense, but i know i would regret it for the rest of my life if i didn't take the chance and try."
why am i here?i am here because i dont know anything about physics instead of taking physics with calculus 1.
the reason i am here at this class because i really wanted the unit to get a minimum of 12 units for my cal grant then my first time coming to this class felt really helpful.
"why am i in this field, in the field of engineering, specifically computer engineering."
"all in all, these reasons are my main motivating factors for pursuing a stem related major or career."
"all very different from one another, then i thought what career would allow me to work with animals, travel and be outside."
"so i am here for my own individual pursuits, and to shape the lives and pursuits of those around me."
but that's why i went into stem.
there are many factors holding me here and keeping me from leaving but definitely to environment has kept me steady and focused on my goal.
i feel like i am also here to teach others my own beliefs and what i think of current issues.
the reason for why i am at san francisco state university is to reach my goal of working in a wildlife rehabilitation or conservation center.
also i needed to take this class if i was gonna take the regular astronomy.
it is the least i could do for all the things they have given and taught me throughout my life
you do not know what will be in front of you or if it will be easy or hard.
i have to blame my mom.
this will keep pushing me to strive to be better.
"here i am now, trying to remember why am i here."
"however, i feel like as long as i can do it correctly."
"as a human physiology student, i know physics is essential to better understand the mechanism of how the human body works."
we cant just wait and hope that someone someday will solve those mysteries for us.
"the specifics of physics hold very little importance in my mind, even if the entire body runs on it i dont need to know how the electric fields of the heart interact because that is only peripherally what i am studying."
"i am here because i am in my second year of college, now meeting the math requirements in order to take this class."
i have a dream that is to learn things in computer science and then program a game myself.
i hope that this class will continue to help prepare me for more moments like those.
"because this is a physics class, and it is related to some common sense in my life, and it has some connection with mathematics."
i believe attending this si course will develop and improve my overall understanding with material i may be struggling in.
"my goal is to graduate with a degree b.ab.s. however graduating with an understanding in scientific field, get involved in biology, reach for new resources, meeting new friends, study in the library, nights of a studying and homework is all worth going to sfsu."
the question came up again in my head entering college.
i like to go on nasas page every now and then to see if they have discovered anything new.
"instead, she pushed me to join the robotics team."
"jackie hernandezseptember 2 2020 why am i here in life, i believe that each of us has a meaningful purpose."
"sometimes, i honestly feel stupid, but i know how to get out of that feeling, and that my friends is why i am here in sci305."
"firstly, i needed to be able to flourish by myself away from home as a young adult."
i think it will be important the things i do now to help with future sceneries.
i am here because not only it is require for my major but to understand more about physics on a university level that i will fully experience for the first time.
good communication can also allow group members to understand their roles and perform better work.
i do not necessarily care about the grade i get as long as i pass.
i know that is class will bring me one step closer to that goal.
i am here because i want a good grade in the class.
especially since the lecture is fastpaced and i would need a midweek review with all the material so i can understand the next day of lectures.
and that is why i am here.
i have set my goals and priorities straight; i prefer to stay home and study rather than to go out because i know in the long run all the studying is going to pay off.
i love my job but my body is starting to disagree.
"so as all over the place this whole write up was i believe i am here on this planet to live my life long dream of being part of the fashion industry, while making a positive impact environmentally."
"i needed, and i stress needed, to learn how to manage my time, personal time, and find my motivation to get through these school days and finish this degree."
college is a privilege and a choice and i choose to educate myself so that i can get a big career in the future.
"i do not know what it is though, but it is a nice thought."
"i just know that since i am here, i need to make the most out of my time."
"i know it won't be an easy road, nothing ever is, but i am willing to put my blood and sweat into it."
the instructors can help me achieve my goals of passing bio 230 by motivating me and assisting me with my biology work.
when you guys had came and explained the class i wish i had taken it sooner.
"personally, i have trouble making time and sitting down to study alone."
"i didnt want to accept the importance behind why physics plays a hefty role in chemical functions, but after spending time looking over the class concepts and materials i am less intimidated by these courses."
"to prove to myself that i am capable of more than is expected of me as a latina, woman of color."
i chose to take this course because it goes along with my physics lecture this semester and it meets my prerequisite requirement for my major.
in highschool physics was very challenging for me but i loved t the entire year because of how interesting it can get.
i feel like this opens opportunities to be friends with someone who is on the same path as you and this is an easy way to get to know others around you and to be able to surround yourself with others who are just like you.
being in this class is important because not only are we reiterating what we learn in phys 101 it helps us grasp the ideas better and easier if we hear them in lecture and demonstrate them in this class as well.
"while it is required of me to take this class, i very much do look forward to learning about the type of physics we cant see much of and learning how this is applicable to everyday life."
i am in this class because i need physics for my major which is cell and molecular biology.
"i was originally unable to make it to come to this section, as i am taking chem 233 that would have overlapped with this class."
one of the main reasons that i am going into the stem field is due to my dad's company.
i am here because i needed to complete this course as part of the biology graduation checklist.
"besides that, i think physic can be such fun."
"first, i took ap physics in high school, so i thought i had a good grasp of things that would go on in class."
i am here in this class to travel my path to that point in my life.
i am majoring in civil engineering and knowing physics is a significant part of the engineering field.
i am a biology major and thus need to take phys 111 and phys 112.
"i enjoy learning about physics, dont get me wrong, but it takes me a while to get the hang of things."
i believe everything i have been through and accomplished has led me to this exact place in my life.
"also, as a kid i have always loved to build and fix stuff and i knew i would be happy if i was able to continue doing this as a profession."
"i also took my friend with me, devin because we're in same physics class so i won't be alone."
however i am glad to be here in the city of san francisco because i believe there are many exciting things to do here.
this pandemic didn't need to happen if our politicians weren't so concerned about themselves and their wealth.
physics can provide me with a basic understanding in how things work and move.
i always wanted to experience a new environment and go from socal to norcal.
you don't think its cool at all?
"this course will help me develop critical thinking skills, and give me a different perspective on life."
"i enjoy stem topics such as mathematics and biology, and i am beginning to become more fond of physics."
physics is also a part of everyday life so learning it can improve the normal life itself.
i hope it works out.
i think i will enjoy this semester a lot more due to the fact that theres more of an appeal to me.
my goal is to get closer to them and learn about them.
it is a great feeling and i hope there are more sci courses offered here for my upper division classes.
i took many classes while there but did not finish the lower division physics requirements.
aside from taking this class for gradutation requirements i also hope to learn some concepts that are discussed in this course.
there are many things that i don't understand and have questions for.
"the reason i included the phrase, ""role model"" is because people who come from my socialeconomic background generally do not end up working in stem. at first i thought i was because most of us don't have an interest in stem, but overtime i've started to believe it's actually because most of us don't get exposed to stem. the way i got exposed to stem is kind of an interesting story."
"i will say that after having done a few of the physics labs already, some of the lecture material is beginning to make sense."
i am also here to build experience in the work force as well as building experience for my resume.
"i also am a very hands oninteractive learner and i dont really get that in the lecture but in this class, i think that i will be able to better understand the material better because of that."
"if we develop another thinking ability, we can survive."
i am here at san francisco state university to receive an education and to major in mechanical engineering.
"im excited for what the future holds, but also nervous because things dont always go as planned."
"a lot of scientific subjects are based on physics, because the laws in physics can be applied to almost any scenario."
why am i in this supplementary instruction class?
why am i going to college?
i recognize that before i started this lab that there was going to be some math involved but i wanted to try something i would have not choose as my first option.
i've taken physics twice in high school: regular physics in my junior year and ap physics my senior year.
"i don't believe that that is the entire reason i'm in the class, however."
"why i'm here then begs the question, who am i?"
"well, i didn't necessarily want to go into stem. actually, i chose to become a computer science major because i want to go into game design, though i'm not sure if i even want to do that anymore."
so far the first lab we did was something i enjoyed but also was a bit difficult because the way the lab was worded was a bit confusing to me.
i do believe physics can play a role in the physical therapy field which is what i am trying to go into.
"i also learned a lot more things throughout the course, such as what the big dipper is, where polaris is, and even how to observe the stars at night and use a compass to see which direction im in and what the altitude is."
i have never taken sci classes because i was lazy or thought i didn't need it.
i also hope to continue learning about something i learned in the pass more in depth .
i don't normally get the chance to go into depth with or look into certain things that i may learn from this class.
"furthermore, this physics lab course will allow me to learn how to use a variety of instruments."
"of course, to get to that point, i had to go to college."
"depth issue, having some background knowledge of other engineering disciplines will make it easier us to understand each other"
i used to be an emt. i loved that job so much.
they sacrificed everything in their life to make sure i went to college and i am grateful for that.
i have learned that many of the different courses actually are related with each other despite being about different concepts.
i wish i was a lot ahead by this age but i won't let that bother me too much.
i am taking physics 230 because it is a prerequisite for my major.
"all i know was, this country will give me a better life than my own country."
i have always had a fascination for biology because it teaches you how things around you and in your body work together to create what we call life.
to understand the concept of physics will help to be more knowledgeable in my surroundings.
but what was i really going to do with all that saved time?
"kinda cheesy, but its the truth.thats why im here."
it is crazy to think that everyday life and actions can be calculated with physics or have to do with physics.
"i feel that i am taking this class because of that but also because it is very valuable to learn to be prepared for the mcat. i hope that through this lab class, i will be able to learn more indepth and truly understand the fundamental concepts in the course."
i took physics back in high school and if i would've gotten a better score on the ap exam then perhaps i would've been taking the second part of physics.
"however, i need to make it through a long hard path of schooling to chase this dream."
"and this course is meant to help my major, or i think it should help."
this way i would be able to relate the lab to the lecture and the lecture material to the lab.
"to answer why i am in a physics course, it is simply because it is a prerequisite for my engineering courses."
"physics will teach me interesting and useful knowledge like motion and behavior through space and time , and the related entities of energy and force."
"although i don't like physics so much before, but i try to learn as much as i can from this short class."
i suppose im taking this sci course so that i can expand my general biology knowledge to see if i can apply biology concepts in my future research work.
"though i may not have a set purpose everyday, what strives me to keep going is the unknown future; it can always be a better day tomorrow."
i am taking both a physics111 sci course and chemistry115 sci course.
"today, i am here to discuss about vectors in 1 dimension and 2 dimensions."
"i don't like waking up early, but that is a sacrifice i am willing to make in order to have the rest of my day to myself."
a large amount of co2 is made by burning fossil fuels.
joining this class will help me prepare for future lectures i will have in chemistry 115.
im taking a sci classso i hope that class will give me a better foundation.
my purpose is to get the most out of life.
"science in general has always been easier for me than history, english, or even math."
"i have taken sci courses for my other science and math classes, and i have learned a lot from my sci instructors regarding class material."
"i think this class will help me with recognizing the physical laws at play in real time, in all aspects of life."
journal 1: why am i here?
computer science can also be used ingame design so technically it is part of my original plan.
"i am majoring in environmental science, i choose this major because of my love for nature and this planet that we live on."
"asking the essay prompt why i am here? to myself, i wonder what here means?"
i was not sure if i wanted to take a sci class but i have never taken a physics class in my life so i knew that this class was supposed to help me out.
so there are some things that i am familiar with.
"also, it is the last physics series i would need to complete and move on forward for additional classes until it is time to graduate from this university."
i am here at this university to help me further my education and to be able to have bachelors degree to hold a successful job.
"however, one of the most important reasons that led me to want to go into stem is that i feel that there is a need for more latinos to be part of stem. i believe that if we can get enough people from every background to be part of stem, we might reach some kind of stability for everyone in all these important jobs."
"after taking a microbiology course when i was a nursing major, i fell in love with it and thought it was fun."
thank you.im back.
"while the distance learning is good and it keeps everyone safe, it has it's complications if some students don't have the proper equipment, and opening schools back up for kids is a very bad idea since kids could spread the virus to others."
"everything to the why it is the way it is to what will it become in the future? before i can even begin to know myself, i think its important to know the biology of a human being,to know how we have changed throughout the years, how some civilizations have mysteriously been completely wiped out."
this class is meant to lay a foundation for the basics of physics and give some background for the future.
"through this class, i hope i can figure out how im understanding the concept through other peoples perspectives and help."
"another reason why i am here is, i like to procrastinate with studying."
"specifically speaking, i'm in this class because it's listed as a class that kinesiology major students have to take."
"i was put through emotional turmoil in the beginning stages of my life, bringing me to develop who i am as a person."
i am here because of something greater putting me here to accomplish something that i may not even know about yet.
for my physics is very difficult to first comprehend which discourages me a lot.
i am very open to learning new things that i have never seen or was taught before.
"the second semester was very laid back, and not in a good way."
"i am taking this sci class (aside from the fact that it is mandatory for me), because i really need that extra push to set aside time to focus on strengthening my knowledge in physics."
my grandma had alzheimers disease and has gotten worse after grandpa passed away.
i think physics help explain how everything works for example i think it would be interesting to know how roller coasters work.
i am excited to take this class because you will really never know what you are going to run into during your experiments.
"after graduating, i stumbled upon optometry and became fascinated with the study of the eyes and their importance."
"taking this hard class online is going to be more hard for me because i already feel scared taking this class and with everything being online, i am actually losing all of my confidence."
i also get to collaborate among leers and that definitely helps me understand the concepts more.
"when i was in high school, everyone really trashtalked community college and how it is only for dumb people who just wanted to experience more high school classes without a social life."
my goal is to complete my bs here at sfsu and then attend dental school.
"dorming at san francisco gave me an opportunity to explore more of the things around me, and myself."
i ended up reading all the books they had on rocks and i didnt know what to read next.
"one reason why i am here, is to be able to better understand the material learned in the parent class with the help of my peers and the instructors of my sci class."
so far i have not had trouble in the class because it is all stuff that i learned in my high school physics class.
"after, you will eventually learn how to tackle and solve the problem that is in front of you."
"i feel that i (and all of us) are here for a reason, and by no miracle we were given our life."
i am here for many different reasons.
right now my purpose in life is just to succeed in school because this whole pandemic has made it so much harder.
physics is one requirement.
"i am interested in physics, however i dont know if this is a class i would take if it is not a prerequisite."
i am a little interested in astronomy so i thought i'd give it a try.
"however, i am not very confident at my physics skill level because i havent been learning any physics subject within these 5 years.in this course, i expect to learn something new that can connect to my daily life."
"in fact, for the computer science classes that do require this as a prerequisite, there is no mention nor use for phys 230 232, as, according to several professors, it is just a prerequisite to keep some undergraduate students from taking the course to early or other things along that line."
i am here for numerous reasons i suppose.
i am here because this class is a prerequisite for my major.
i have always had issues with my science classes mainly because i have a chronic pain disorder called fibromyalgia.
i would like to say that physics was a bit tough for me back when i took the course originally as i am not good with math.
"although that is my outlook on it, this question can become more in debt by adding on to the question continuously for example; why am i here in college?"
the reason i took this class is because it is required to take for my major which is general biology.
"although vectors are briefly mentioned in my previous math classes, the concept of it still help me understand this physic aspect of it."
"i took ap physics in high school and my teacher was cool, but could not really teach well."
i am here at san fransisco state university to get my degree in business and take that degree to get my dream job.
but even after that i really don't know why we are put into this earth.
"i have joined this class not only because it seemed interesting, but also because i have been fascinated by astronomy since i was a child."
i am here in my astronomy lab class to further my knowledge of astronomy.
i am excited to delve deeper into physics and learn more about the intricacies of how the world and the universe works based on science.
"coming to san francisco state university was not easy at all, especially the language, community, environment, and the surroundings."
i also took care of my grandma's medication before she passed away so i was also just interested in how other medications can affect the body.
i am here because it's helps fulfill my requirement to take physics 111.
i'm here because this is a class that i need for my major.
i did not want to stall my time any longer so i decided to try sfsu and it worked better in my favor.
"not too overwhelmed, which is worrying me because im almost always stressed."
"i was brought to this class through major requirements, however, i initially chose biology as my major because i have future plans to go into the medical field as my career."
"why am i here? theres a lot of reasons as to why i am here, attending college."
i can't explain why but i came out here for school but also to force myself to meet people.
"you will be graded on participation only, not on the specifics of what you say."
we go step by step and explanations why it is the way it is.
"although it wasnt too difficult, i had to put a lot of effort into that course."
"this semester is much more stressful than last semester, so i need these sci classes in order to help me understand the material and be able to utilize what i learn."
"not saying i dont care or whatever, im just saying a ge is a ge and you gotta do what you gotta do."
it is a prerequisite for the next physics class i need.
that is just one of the many reasons.
"even in my major (chemistry, specifically organic) physics drives the principals we use to develop novel synthetic pathways."
that is so interesting question.
i am taking this course because it is a requirement for my major .
my family has motivated me to do well in school so that i can get a job in something that is interesting to me and that pays well since they were never able to get an opportunity like this.
"additionally, i hope for a productive school year, and i hope to be mentally and physically healthy as i study and go to work."
recently i have switched my major to civil engineering making this class my 2nd to last physics lab before i actually am done with my physics requirement.
"after about a year and a half into my college journey, i found something i was interested in and passionate about, skincare."
i am here because i love science.
"i also have a great time in class, as it is fun to be there and actually enjoyable."
i heard that this class would help me get a better grasp of things and introduce me to new ways of studying and working in groups to solve problems.
as a kid i never would have pictured myself here today.
"by doing well in physics ii, i am also able to show ucsf that i can excel in material that i am not passionate about and this is telling them that i can do well even if the topics that they might teach me is not particularly exciting in my opinion."
i really hope this class will be fun and help reiterate the curriculum i have learned in my physics class.
i like science and love my degree and i'm here to make a difference in this world.
"physics has an innovative thinking way, deduction."
"however, i think it will help me be able to have a deeper understanding and meaning of the universe, and the basic tasks that i do on a daily basis."
"i like physics, i like the formulae and the math."
"i chose to go to sf state since i was born and raised in irvine, california (in socal) and had never lived anywhere else before."
im here because society is set up in a way that if you dont go to college and get a degree you cannot succeed.
i am in physics 112 because it is one of the requirements to stay enrolled in physics 111.
i have enjoyed my time at sfsu and have learned a lot.
"i find computer science interesting and cool, and i also find physics really interesting which is something i hadnt discovered until i started to take physics class."
"after taking biotechnology, i took chemistry and then biology and i knew that this was something i wanted to do for the rest of my life."
"however, physics is never meant to be like math."
if all other virtual labs are able to deliver the same results i would say say it'll be a success because learning is the goal.
if newton didnt invent calculus we might not have einsteins theory of relativity.
ive always been very independent person when it came to school but coming to college.
it means actually making it out.
"i could do decently well in one semester, but at the end of it, i realize that while i may have learned a thing or two about a certain subject, i haven't learned how to actually do anything with that new knowledge, and the class material gets quickly forgotten."
i really hope i will do good this semester and the next with general physics two.
"i would love to work with elders and get to know them, their stories, and experiences."
"set at an unspecified date in earth's future, the novel presents imperiled humankind after two conflicts with theformics, aninsectoidalien speciesthey dub the ""buggers""."
"because i always dreamt of becoming a dentist; therefore, this class and all my other classes have a significant impact on my life."
i hope that this class affords me with the knowledge i need to excel in my field as a scientist.
i am here in this class because chemistry has always been a class that was a bit challenging for me.
"nows after reflecting my choices to answer the question of why i am here, i guess the answer is because i want to be here."
"i am majoring in kin and want to be a nurse when im older, to be a nurse i need more understanding of movement in the body and physics will help me with that."
"in order to be an occupational therapist, i need to learn physics because kinesiology is basically just the physics of the body."
to understand having two of the same charges repel each other while two different charges attract.
"with taking this class, it also helps me to understand the formula or theory that i used in my physics class."
roger truong sci305 reflective journal essay 1 02182020 916324765 my name is roger truong.
"that being said, i still enjoy physics."
to understand lecture better.
"i like doing lab work so i was really excited to be in a physics lab but unfortunately, we cannot because of our states current battle with covid and the fires as well."
i am here in this lab class because i needed to finish one of my general education requirements.
then when i would get to the homework i was lost and got discourage so i didnt turn in the homework.
"i really like doing experiments and engaging with other individuals, im hoping that this class will consist of much of that."
"something about physics that actually struck me was its applications, i.e. when i actually tried to relate it more to the events that were actually occurring around us, like circular motion, slipping of vehicles on a wet road, etc."
"i actually meet some cool people so far, like name 1 and name 2."
why am i here ?
i am here because i am lucky enough to have the opportunity to attend a school in a nice city.
and by that i mean learn things i never had someone tell me.
not because i wanted too.
to one day use my education to make a bunch of money and repay them everything they have done for me because they deserve it.
reflection 1: why am i here?
being lectured and then left on our own to do labs was something i looked forward to every week.
all the stem classes are closely connected and they intertwine with one another.
i am majoring in kinesiology with an emphasis on exercise science.
"that being said, i have came across various situations where peoples lives have been taken too early on and because of those experiences, i know how important it is to value living and being here."
"im here to be more involved and focused on concepts that i am having a difficult time understanding, i am also here to work with students with different learning abilities and take them in as learning objectives for myself."
i didn't fail because the class is hard.
i am aware of my weaknesses and as a fifth year student i have learned that not speaking up when you need help can be your ultimate downfall in any class.
through different experiences ive come to solidify the idea that math and science is something near and dear to my heart because it is where my brain works the best.
alexa maldonadosci 227 21720reflective journal 1 why am i here?i am in this course to earn a decent grade in calc ii. i need the extra support because i hardly remember anything from calculus i since i took it during the summer.
"in this lab we will do the experiments related to sound, speed, lengths, forces etc."
"i loved learning about the stars, planets, earths atmosphere, dark matter, the search for intelligent life...all of the subjects in astr 115 i just completely fell in love with and i thought, i could study this for the rest of my life."
"fastforeword 18 years, three kids later, and one on their way to college."
i have not taken physics since freshman year of high school and i think it will be good to learn everything i have forgotten over the years again.
"on my free time, i am a pretty avid photographer and the city is perfect for just that."
i am in this physics 122 class because i miraculously made it past physics 111 which is one of the hardest classes i have taken at this school.
"i'm here to learn and prepare myself for the future by gaining more learning skills such as problem solving, teamgroup work activities and critical thinking."
i also would like to work for a lab but i need more experience and connections before i think of doing so.
he has inspired me to leave and go to college and major in bio so i can fully understand his condition.
i'm taking si because it helps me not be afraid.
building and working with the earth will use a lot of my understanding of physics.
a couple of bumps here and there were felt but they were definitely avoidable.
"at the sci classes, we usually go over worksheets that answer my questions."
i remember my physics class in high school was very interesting and i recall learning a few things.
"i seek balance, shadow and light, ebb and flow, waning and waxing, within my daily universe."
personally i find that thats the best way to learn and truly master a classes concepts.
they start to open up and talk about their issues and health problems.
"after high school, i ended up attending a community college where i didn't really know exactly what i wanted to do."
i am more passionate more than ever to achieve my goals.
"i realized after taking discrete math that logic comes much more naturally to me than other types of math ive studiedlogic gates, knights and knaves, and eulerian paths all made a lot of sense to me.ive worked a couple places doing stem education, especially programs for young girls, because i never really believed that i could be capable or competent in any stem field."
i also like the handson experience or experiments involved in physics.
i am here because i am a biology major going into human genetics.
though i enjoy the material and find it interesting its simply not coming to me easily in the slightest.
"bio can be a little daunting, especially since i haven't taken a sci class for bio since the beginning of sophomore year, i look forward to being apart of the class and am thankful that the section for this class was able to stay open!"
"i am here because i genuinely loved my astronomy class last school year and i did not want to take a lab for biology, so i chose to continue with astronomy lab."
i dont know why im here.
think about it geniuses like einstein or sports phenoms like lebron james matter to us. even though they have nothing to do with us we admire them because of their will and their potential to or ability to do things we hadn't seen before.
"however, that same freedom can backfire and create bad habits."
i have spent over 3 years in a community college so i have class experience and understand what is important to me.
im attending sfsu because i am trying to get a major in physiology.
im thankful for the opportunity to attend university away from home and get my degree.
i look forward to completing this course with an overall positive experience and i also hope to do well in the course.
it's a nice opportunity to deepen my appreciation for space.
what i am learning now will transfer over to other subjects like microbiology and biochemistry.
"it is important for me to understand the concepts of physics, which will help in other parts of life as well."
i am taking this sci 115 course so it can help me get a better grade in chem 115 lectures.
"luckily, i was able to easily switch to health sciences and i have been pretty content with where i am at so far."
"unfortunately, the world we live in is flawed, and everyone we encounter is flawed."
i knew going into the semester i was going to need some extra help with this class so when i found out about this class i didn't hesitate to sign up.
"i am at home, lying in bed, because there is a pandemic going on in the world and now school takes place online through meetings on zoom."
i like the way class does.
exams are my weakness and often stopped me from getting as.
this is why i am a chemistry major.
"in another lab i learned under your teaching was about how to calculate area, volume, and density using the formulas given."
"then i had a conversation with my mom about this college and, is closer to grandmas house which i can help take care of my grandma after school."
"so far, i see this class as people who have a similar goal to get the job done, and in a hardworking atmosphere, it makes it a lot easier."
"taking physics 102 lab is for me to understand how physics worked in real life and understanding how it relates to every aspect in life, without the confusion of large numerical values and equations."
another way physics can be useful is because the body constantly uses torque and forces just to move.
i'm enrolled in this class so that i have a better understanding of the material taught in my physics class.
i started to get interested in the path of medicine ever since i've been in high school but during that time i was also interested in psychology and thought maybe the topic would be interesting to learn.
i am here to finish my ge prerequisites so i can finally graduate and start paying of my loans.
"know do i know exactly, no."
"since it is a prerequisite, i am going to have to suck it up and try my best in order to be successful in my college journey."
many are lost within themselves because they have not found their purpose.
"honestly, the only question i do know the answer to is why im taking a physics class it's a prerequisite for medical school, pa school, dental school, you name it."
"i love math and love to explore it, and physics also helps me learn math, so i am here."
i was also excited to learn more about the stars and planets in our universe because it would answer questions that i already had about the universe.
being able to do well in a challenging class like physics ii will further validate that i am able to excel in a challenging curriculum and will further convince ucsf that i am a good fit for their program.
she said that after class she would go up to the professor and ask him a bunch of questions about space that she was wondering about.
the reason i am here is because of my major.
i hope to do well in all my classes this semester !
the general reason towards why im here is because of my parents.
"i just hope i can take a small break, maybe a year, and just fully rest."
i guess i'll answer it as if you're wondering why i'm at this school.
"before moving to san francisco, i was a regular volunteer at the san diego humane society, my local animal shelter, for nearly three years."
"if you ask why am i at san francisco state university, i would tell you that i am chasing a degree."
i am in this class because physics is a prerequisite i must take to get into physics 122 in order to fulfill major requirements.
i am majoring in electrical engineering because it was either pick a stem major or get disowned and electrical engineering was the stem major that i seemed least repulsive to me.
"i never want anyone to feel that way, so i make sure that no matter who enters my life, i become someone they can trust and confide in."
as for why i am on this.
"also, keep this program going because its really important to me and to people learning math in the future."
i also really like that it is a super small class and we only meet once a week.
i felt as that i had made a change in the world and impacted so many lives already.
i sometimes even think maybe i wasn't meant to always be in people's lives all the time forever but it was nice to meet them and there is always that hope that we will meet again.
"in a general context, i have learned some physics in high school, but not as thorough and engaging as i would have enjoyed."
i need to pass physics and i feel the only way i could do that is by taking this sci course.
"being a young person can be difficult sometimes because as your developing, you start to learn how overwhelming your own emotions can be, how complex the world is, how scary and different it is from how you imagined."
i didn't know that physics had to do something with my major.
"later on in my life after high school, i realized that i had quite an obsession with space and stars, and the galaxies, and materials that make up this universe."
i commute everyday from san jose to sf. it's not too bad; i've gotten used to it.
my interest is pretty okay with science of how things work around me to an intend.
i like doing experiments and messing with things but other than not wanting to miss class.
"with a degree in psychology, i plan on becoming a mental health counselor."
"however, given that it's about charges and eventually magneticelectrical fields around wirescoilsetc, i assume it must be at least a little important to know."
"i could have taken a lower physics course, but i know grad schools like to see more challenging classes."
"however, it does open up a lot of doors for some individuals."
i am currently enrolled in this sci 115 section because of my current and future career aspirations.
"i signed up for this class because chemistry is really tough subject for me to understand and last semester in my sci class i made friends that helped me study when i need help,"
i teach and learn lessons as i go as to what my purpose is.
overall i think i am here because i enjoy studying physics and it covers two of my ge's but i am enjoying it.
i think it's incredibly useful especially in video games which is probably why i like games so much.
it is not always easy to meet with a professor or to meet people to study with.
"it's an easy class and a great way to boost my gpa. adding on, since i don't have a class that can allow me to unwind, this was the closest i could get."
it would be much nicer if we could have class in person though!
i often question myself how different my life would be or how it would my life be if i was not who i am.
like college in general since its taking a bit longer than id like.
why am i here?i am here because i struggle in chemistry.
i only have 2 maybe 1 12 more years.
i hope i enjoy learning physics.
"also, i am taking this class to fulfill my prerequisites."
i have always been a hardworking student but i do struggle even though i am a stem major.
im a stem major or more specifically im a mechanical engineering major.
"in this class, i aim to strengthen my skills and refine my scientific procedure to the max."
or maybe it is simply asking why i took this class.
"i chose this major because i love studying chemistry, organic chemistry, and human biology, typically involving the cells and microbes part."
im here to get more support for chem115.
"to make it clear, i dont want to be here."
"as for me, when i hear that question, i automatically think of a particular place in my life."
i do hope to be successful within myself and my capabilities.
"the reason for me to be here, is to really understand how physics works."
"i have to take these classes for my biology major, as it is a requirement."
"but before that, my parent had also been into the stem field ( engineer and a doctor) and it was expected of me to be in the same field as well."
i am a chemistry major and that requires this course to be completed.
we all know that physics apply to the real world.
"the main reason why i chose san francisco state university is because it's more convenient for me to commute between home, work, and school."
when i was younger i enjoyed maths because it came easy to me.
i want to go to physical therapy school.
"this is truly my first real physics course which is pretty nerve racking, in high school i didn't need to take it, so i am excited to see why everyone loves this subject so much!"
i only chose that because i liked physics in high school.
i think physics will be interesting if i was the most curious person in the world.
i really hope that this course will help me expand my understanding of physics by introducing new techniques like using calculus to solve problems.
"sometimes labs are difficult because some materials are new, and time is not sufficient."
i like doing physically competitive stuff with friends and people.
"i quickly realized that if wanted to do this, i was going to have to return to college."
but i get to an hour of studying on the ferry so i can be done with work when i get home.
the final reason i would say i am here is to learn.
i am eager to finally get a better grasp of understanding physics and seeing how it can be applied to our outside world.
i am in this sci class in the hopes of getting a really good grade in general physics 1.
"i have felt pretty bad about that for ages, so when it cake time to choose a lab, i figured i could try to redeem myself."
i almost failed the class and it really discouraged me.
i am here primarily because i need a lab credit to graduate.
i invested more time into my social life once spring came around.
"in addition, they make a lot of money so it helps you out financially too."
"afterwards, i want to branch out on my own or with others to create a new mobile app."
in this class i hope to gain the handson lab skills for the physics laws and material.
i am here because i decided that i did not want to become a nurse.
"it is related to some of the topics we have already discussed in class, such as velocity, acceleration, and distance."
"i would like to learn about stars, planet, sun, and moon."
"there were many career paths i wanted to take before this such as becoming a vet, therapist and blood splatter analyst."
i actually really like it because i remember back in high school always having a good time while taking it.
"i am here because i am on that path towards my success, and i believe with my own efforts i can make it there."
well it might be hard because it's all math and i haven't been doing so well lately.
"after much thought, i did not want to take biology with a lab, nor take chemistry with a lab as those classes seem to be more difficult."
as well as covers some requirements for graduating.
i know that the sci courses are meant to be personalize attention and increase the understanding of the material so i am taking advantage of that resource.
i have always been fascinated by how things work and the inner mechanics of anything that has a motor or gears.
"while i was there, i appreciated a new setting compared to suburban san diego."
"due to this, i had the repetition of doing math problems, or solving word problems, which is why it is a little harder for me compared to everyone else, to solve logical and critical thinking problems and takes me a little longer."
"i am here in this school because i did not want to go in to debt after college so i chose to go to san francisco state university and not university of california, santa cruz, like i wanted to."
"this sparked a natural curiosity inside of me to pursue this knowledge further.eventually, when i attended high school, i was apart of an internship at the california academy of sciences as an education intern who would teach people about the various scientific topics that were being discussed there."
i have hopes of getting into a career in healthcare.
why am i in college?
"this class will help me further my understanding, and more importantly have me continue on my major pathway."
"secondly, this class is effective in terms of covering material and time."
i am here because i chose to follow my heart and see where this beautiful relationship will take me.
also the course itself is something that i am interested in because i enjoy understanding the way things move and how to calculate them.
i understand that physics is in our everyday lives.
"this class was also appealing to me, because it's 1 more unit and there basically is no final for this class since it is just and extension of the main chem class which is coo."
"i hope to change this and by advancing my education, i am further able to assist more students in various different fields, such as physics."
in being in this class i strongly feel that it will help me accomplish the goal of opening up my own veterinarian clinic and helping animals that are going extinct and make my clinic a sanctuary for animals that have gotten hurt in the wild or by people trying to hunt them.
by listening to myself more ive been able to find a path to move forward on.
i chose bio 230 (mainly because it's a requirement of my major) but also because it's and introductory biology course for my major.
i am also a biology major and taking physics is one of my general ed requirements.
at first i did not understand why this course was a requirement but now know that it is crucial to know physics to be able to understand how and why things move and to what extent that movement effects the thing or object.
"ive always been interested in computers since i was a kid, and i currently love doing mobile app development as a hobby (and hopefully one day a career or job!)."
"i'm here because i plan on becoming a veterinarian in the future, in order to do that, i have to take physics in addition to a few other classes."
im not sure what here really is.
"i am in a physics class because i need to take one to get a biology degree, and to achieve my career goals of becoming a wildlife biologist (but still open to other opportunities)."
although this is a science class it also involves a lot of math and that has never really been my strongest subject.
since i added later on in class i am not really understanding how the class structure works.
through this class and every class i expect them to only add to my experience needed for my educational pathway.
i appreciate physics for its precision and the power that comes with it.
"i guess you could call that ""kinetic energy"" haha."
"im taking this sci 115 course to guarantee studying for chem 115 and to overall feel prepared for exams, homework, etc."
i also want to always expand my mind and keep all my options open.
"physics is something that applies to all of us in day to day life, thus being in this class, it would be interesting to see which rules of physics are being applied in what we do."
i am taking this sci course because i tend to need extra help with my chemistry courses.
"as a biology major, even though physics is different from biology, i think learning about all the fields in science is helpful in understanding the world."
my friends and i decided to join science 115 to learn for deep about the lectures we learned in chemistry 115 class.
taking this physics course will hopefully instill me with valuable knowledge i can use to be successful in a work environment.
"when we call our family with the cell phone, our voice is converted into an electrical signal."
"im interested in learning about physics for the first time, as well."
well am i not be smart enough but i work hard enough to be here.
"i still get really hard on myself each time i slip up, but i hope i can be more of a best friend to myself in some way."
"i could probably take on physics without take a supplementary class, but taking physics along with chemistry, calculus, and biology during the same semester is rather risky."
"we get to do more hand on activities which is how i kind of learn better, or it's proven for people to learn better this way."
"having a graphic designer major, the two would think not to go well together, but i believe that they do go hand in hand with each other."
biology and chemistry courses have been great because they come naturally to me.
so there are a few different ways it seems we couldve gone with this question but ill go with the why am i here in context to this school.
my main goal out of this class is to understand the material well and succeed in this class.
i am here because i was getting home sick and i did not want to be far away from home.
"he made his dreams come true, but it did not really last long."
"the homework can be a little difficult, mostly because a lot of the material on it can be things that we haven't covered yet."
"throughout my life, i've always wondered what the meaning of life is and what's our purpose as human beings."
in high school the physics labs were very superficial and i hope that this lab covers the concepts in more depth and has more labs that can thoroughly describe concepts.
"unfortunately, i joined the sci class as we were beginning to go over unit three, so i am hoping there will be someone i can ask for assistance with the other units."
did you know that the only stem field to see a decrease in women in the last 30 years was computer science?
it is so intriguing to learn about something greater than myself.
so yeah that's why i am here.
it should be rather an elective course for those who plan to or are interested in computer science fields that deal with that such as biotech or other fields that need this knowledge to build and code the information necessary to make the instruments work for them.
this is my first ever semester taking a chemistry class ever.
i tried my best to take the most general of general education classes while i was still deciding my major.
"this isnt an issue for me, but it does feel punishing to be here in a sense."
growing up i would go to yosemite a lot and we would always star gaze.
im willing to work hard for this grade and do whatever is necessary to do well.
i believe i am here because i am trying to learn what i need to know in order to get into the career i want.
hopefully ill learn something useful that i can use later in the future or present.
i have been having trouble with getting use to this new online platform because i am use to in class sessions.
i wonder why i'm here all the time.
"if i had done precalculus in high school, which was an option for me, i would have been able to take this physics class sooner."
"now with the understanding of where physics falls on my plan to physical therapy, my views have improved."
i want to save lifes.
i am here not to become a failure nor end up like many that called inquits after their freshmen year.
i am here in this class for various reasons.
but i just haven't reached the conclusion of that question for myself.
i have attended the physics lab class this semester.
what happens when a ball falls down?
"moreover, getting into a great physical therapy program will eventually lead to fulfilling a goal of mine."
"i know that sometimes we go in groups for labs and i am pretty comfortable with doing group lab projects.the other reason i took this class is because i know it will benefit me in the future with other classes such as math, chemistry, biology, and much more."
it is not my time to die yet.
our question was which college we are planning to go too.
i was never very good at math and i knew that physics requires a lot of math problems.
we are here to love one another and to make discoveries regarding the world.
the instructors took us out at night took look at all the constilations and i loved it.
last semester i took chemistry 115 and sci 115 concurrently and it helped me understand more about the parent class.
the reason why i am in this class is because it is required for my major.
"physics is a requirement, but aside from being a prereq...."
"after that, i wanted to become a paleontologist, teacher, then an astronomer."
optometric has so many physics calculation to determine patient eye number so what i need is to improve my skill from physics base to achieve my goal.
i was wrong when he made his video lectures he made them overly explained.
"i took general physics 1 last summer semester as a head start, so now im taking general physics two now."
i am also here to further my education so i can work in the medical industry.
college is completely up to you so i don't go into my classes with the mindset of why are we even learning this.
i have also been fasting for the month of ramadan the last month so that has been keeping me occupied.
i'm here to move through my degree requirments.
the only classes that i would take would be chem classes.
"we never left the bay, and i had lived my entire childhood in the cities san francisco and daly city."
"in addition to that, i am here in the class because i need this class to fulfill my ge requirement for graduating with biology physiology major."
the excitement of science keeps me engaged and it satisfies my curiosity in a way that plain mathematics does not.
but then i found out about this sci class and the first day i learned more than what he had taught.
very enthusiastic about teaching which i live because some teachers are like this is just my paycheck and do not care.
the topic that i am very familiar with would be about forces and gravity.
"also, i'm a visual learner, so the lab will help me learn more about the topic i learn from the lecture."
for most of us here it is to graduate with a degree from a higher learning institution so that we may gain a job and finally make money to support ourselves.
i have never taken a physics course in my life and it makes me very anxious because there are a number of people that have seen what we are covering previously and i have never seen any of it.
each experiment in this class helps me to improve my knowledge in physics and physics is important because it helps us to understand our world better and even improve life by giving us technologies.
"physics will allow me to understand concepts like distance, speed, and motion, which are involved in daily life, so it will broaden my understanding of the world overall."
i'm only taking this class because i have to for my major physics is actually my least favorite part of science.
"mostly, i am in this sci class so that i can get the best mastery of physics 111 topics and raise my gpa. without ever having taken a physics class, i do have some anxiety about the new material and applying complex math to some of the material."
"im here because i dont want to be struggling in my life in the future, i dont want to be in low income."
overall i am here taking a college course to obtain a degree in microbiology and work as a clinical laboratory scientist.
this will be the time for me to learn more about what causes some objects to move and solving math problems using physics.
i think it will increase the magnitude of the impact on others lives.
"i am a second year student at sf state, major in computer science."
"also, i think that college is a good experience."
i took the lab last semester too and passed but i struggled passing the lecture because i didn't do too well on the exams.
"therefore, i decided to switch back to my very original plan to study biology."
how we are trying to find life.
why did i chose to take a career path that requires this course?
now a days there arent many good paying jobs that hire a person with just a high school diploma unless you get lucky.
however if im being honest i do like physics more than my major and would have become a physics major if the pay of my civil engineering major didnt convince me otherwise.
honestly i am here because i have to be here.
"therefore, this class will help me in depth of why everything happens the way it does."
"building off that, in essence, i am in this course to complete the graduation requirements for my major."
"i hope after taking this course this semester that i at least get something out of it, anything, even as small as knowing a moon phase."
i needed to take this course since my major requires it.
i just probably would not take this course or any other physics course if it werent required.
though i also heard from a number of employers that cs graduates often can't code their way out of a paper bag.the actual cs knowledge you need for a job can be learned in a few months.
"well, first and foremost i need to go into the stem field because i am a mechanical engineering major."
i'm not sure if you're asking why am i here at sf state or just on this planet in general.
"i am a student in university for a reason, that reason being to be able to succeed in my future career and lifestyle."
i am passionate and educated on the subject.
"i can honestly say this is one of the hardest classes ive taken so far, since i had trouble understanding since day one lecture."
my biggest source of influence has come from my family and the people i surround myself with.
i find physics very difficult to learn and study but it also brings curiosity to my mind.
"i have always been intimidated by physics, but i am excited to learn the material and finally get an understanding to the laws and methods that i have seen."
we also use physics to help better understand earthquakes and the displacement of the ground from tectonic activity.
i was not planning on being a biology major from the start so i never thought i would be taking physics again but i am excited to tackle this course and learn more about physics.
it allows us to dig deeper into each subject and truly understand the things we might have missed before.
"growing up, i always had an interest in literature, and then music."
"i have taken the prerequisite course to this, and i am currently enrolled in the lecture portion of the class."
i decided to come to sfsu to spend these last 2 years of my bachelors degree as focused as possible with no distractions to hold me back from reaching my goal.
23209why am i here?
i feel university can help me accomplish that and so far it has.
"im not a great person that actually studies so, this class is literally perfect because we go over a lot without doing it all by myself or procrastinating."
"but more specifically, i came to sf state to finish up my ba degree and to play for the men's basketball team here."
"yesica onofre fletesseptember 2, 2020reflective journaling 1""why am i here?"" i think everyone has a different purpose to why they are here today."
"i was scared that i would not understand anything, but im doing better than i thought."
having practice problems and discussions with fellow classmates about class material helps me to review class material that i may miss or not understand fully.
"though these obstacles may be tough, i try my best to push through because i know i can."
and i wanted to be considered a full time student so she recommended i take the support class for chem 115 and biol 240 so i can have 12 units.
i then chose to go to college in san francisco because it was a city i always loved ever since the first time i went i fell in love and its a place where i wanted to learn more.
"it could be worse though, at least i don't have any 8 ams. this is my first lab course that feels like a real lab course, so i am very excited to see where this goes!"
physics happens to be a branch of education of my cs degree so that's a majority of the reason i'm taking the class.
"i am in the sci class for chemistry, because i feel like it will help my understanding of the chemistry concepts."
i feel like i am doing a lot of the handson stuff that we never got to do during the lecture class.
i am here so i can walk across att park and experience graduating there.
other than that i dont know why i am here other than that.
"luckily, he told me he would always be there for my brothers and i when the time to buy a house would come."
"sci 230 gives me more time to review everything and let it sink it, or to go over questions with everyone else."
"another reason why i took this class if i am being honest is because since this class deals with my major, i know some things about astronomy so i thought it would be the easiest lab class to take."
i took this sci coarse because i have no prior knowledge of physics.
"based on my understanding of how i learn so far, i think that i am more of a listen, write it down, and speak it type of learner."
im also taking this class because space and astronomy have interested me ever since i was little and i want to be able to answer my questions i had when i was younger.
to live life to its fullest and see where life takes me.
i really started being interested in astronomy in 6th grade when i was at science camp.
i use the understanding of forces to create the leveling effect without having to drill walls and be removable.
"also, because a different person might describe it differently than the professor."
hopefully i met the word count.
"although i haven't experienced another ""season"" yet, i am already worried about missing out on my beautiful ohio autumn."
i am also here because i made a choice to study computer engineering and not nursing because of how impacting it was and my interest in computer since i was young.
i am pursuing medicine because i love to understand how the body works.
"also, another reason i wanted to take physics is because i want to be a music producer and i know that dealing with frequencies and sound waves is a big part of that so i figured that understanding the science behind it would help me improve."
the advisors emphasized that they highly recommend we take this supplemental class if our schedules allow us to add it.
that is why i will try my best to understand the concepts i am being taught.
"however, so far i have been able to understand the material better."
but recently ive ventured into starting up my own food business thats based around my culture.
"to get a better grade, get help with the lectures."
"i asked around my study group at the time what classes should i take, they suggested a try sci class to complement my general chemistry 2 class."
"since i didn't get accepted into the architecture schools i applied for, i decided to move towards san francisco state in order to study computer science."
i tend to get so distracted by the fun things in life and forget that the hard stuff is what will define my future.
physics is difficult for me and i need all the help that i can to fix my struggle with it.
a lot of things have changed in the past couple of years but i do intend to be very interactive and participate during lab.
not like im here against my will or anything.
"i have a passion for babies and i myself when i was born, was born in a car, so i was incubated for about a month because i did not have much oxygen, so it was a scary moment for both my parents."
i continue to remain here because of my fight to improve the educational institution and create a safer and stronger support system for future generations to come.
i do enjoy going to the planetarium and having the extra push to look up at the moon and stars.
i am excited to go to the planetarium by myself and look at the stars.
"although the physics class is not so bad to understand, the lab is difficult to do because we apply our knowledge from the class into the experiments we do in the lab."
medical schools want to see that not only have you taken labs required for your major but labs outside of school is very important as well.
"i am here because i have a dream, and in order to reach that dream i have to make certain steps."
danica micaelscience 115journal 1 why am i here?
i am a hands on learner so i truly feel like these labs are going to be a bit hard for me because there is no actual one on one face to face with the professor.
i am here because i enjoy studying astronomy and physics.
i just want to be here for my loved ones and be able to do what i love and to not have any stress or worry in the world.
this class will also help me review and better prepare myself for when we have exams.
im taking sci because i honestly think you can help me i took physics one sci and it helped a ton.
some answers may be from justifying this is my goal in life and it is set that way.
college is expected to move forth in a career.
"when i took physics in high school, i really liked the class and found it to be really interesting."
why am i here?sometimes i find myself asking that very question.
"i believe that purpose is to see which people were caring and nice, and which people are mean and a threat to society."
"though, it is fun to actually play with charges and currents."
reflection 1 why am i here?
also this is the only class time that work for my schedule.
don't get me wrong.
"i've taken si before and i went into it just thinking about a study group type of class, and it kinda is like that but i've discovered it's more than just studying."
i havent chosen a major but ive thought about going into biology or perhaps another kind of science so taking this class seemed like a good idea.
"i took physics in high school and really enjoyed it, so i am hoping that the experience extends into college."
"i find physics to be quite difficult, however i'm taking it in order to have an understanding for it so that i am able to apply it into my computer science work in the future."
i wanted to learn more about the things and enjoyed and how people were able to design the mechanics of a game.
"i picked this degree to use the knowledge gained to create, build, and develop business in the future."
i also have always been better at math and sciences than my other studies.
college is a place where you can further your knowledge and learn new skills.
i do not need to and do not want to understand exactly why things do the things they do.
"in any case, i intend to keep moving forward in this path and to make any necessary changes as the situation seems fit."
i see dozens of people sitting next to me all the time but we do not have the time or opportunity to socialize with one another.
"i'm partially here because this class is for my major, but i am also motivated to learn something new."
"and not so much as academically, but learn life lessons, values and experience what it is like to be human."
"just from my impression of the last fall semester, physics is pretty difficult for me especially when it comes to calculus."
i really hope that everything i get to learn about in this class would be helpful to be applied to our everyday life situations.
the second reason is that it is really interesting and useful to know a lot of the stuff that you would learn when getting a stem degree.
week one hit me hard but i think i will bounce back this week against hollywood.
"despite being my first day, i am still honored to be able to have a seat."
i ended up choosing this school because of the affordability and location.
one reason is the base housing allowance is the highest in california.
i dont have much of a want to be here but a need to be here as physics is a concrete foundation in learning other topics.
"three years later, i came back to this school to finish what i have started and i am not stopping and definitely do not plan to repeat any of my major required courses."
"i am at a point in my life where i only have one goal and that is to do well in school, so that i can later go into a profession where i feel happy and satisfied with my life."
"even though i am a biochemistry major, whenever i take physics i learn so much about every day life things and it makes my biochem classes make more sense sometimes."
understand my purpose.
as a computer science major i understand the importance of understanding physics but do not see myself utilizing all of the formulas and information i learn here in the future.
for that reason i am taking physics because i enjoy studying the topic.
"i am passionate about using what i learn here to improve the world, because i believe that to combat global warming we must create something revolutionary."
"i didnt have time for the lab, therefore, i am took it this semester."
it had always given me the impression that it was hard.
i decided to still transfer despite sfsu not being my first choice.
whenever im struggling i know i can fall back on science.
i think the reason why i am in this class is that i hope to learn more physics knowledge.
whatever it is that i end up doing i hope that it is something that makes me happy.
"i was supposed to take this class last semester, but i had a lot on my plate."
i have never taken a sci course so this will be the first semester where i participate in this type of class.
his name was mr. galaz.
i am here after class finishing my assignments and tying loose ends to ensure i am doing everything possible to have a good grade.
which molecules are present in the sky?
even though i have to take this class i am interested in physics and know it is something i need knowledge in.
the reason i am taking physics is because it's a required course for my biology major.
but i'm hopeful that this semester i will find a way to appreciate physics because i love learning and i can't really picture my life as being anything other than a student.
why am i here.
thank you for the opportunity to learn about physics and how experiments are done in a laboratory.
i am here for a lot of reasons.
the next semester my instructor in precalc told me to minor in math!
"also not only because of the major requirements, i am also interested in physics a lot."
"today's lab is on thermal expansion, and i hope from the name that means we get to see some metal expanding."
science was also a much more interesting class to me than english or history.
ive heard many bad stories about how difficult engr305 can potentially be from several fellow classmates who have already taken it.
"but the day i learned about computers and how it can solve any problem with right thinking, i decided that i will go into the field of computer science."
"although i failed most of the test i began to go in for help and spend more time, maybe sometimes six hours a day trying to understand the concepts."
"my decision to take this course also was because it is only once a week for two hours, and i don't feel as pressured to be good in the subject because everyone else in the class also feels uneasy as it is a difficult subject."
since math and physics are related to each other i would need to take all the required pre physics class along with all the other pre math required class in order to move onto the higher level of physics and math classes.
im excited to learn all the interesting facts of astrology.
i also like to see new pictures that the rovers or satellites have taken.
"that class never felt like a chore to go to, and was one of my favorite, if not my favorite class i have ever taken in my college career thus far."
i want a title but the authority to be that person.
i'm so into these kinda things.
i am fulfilling my prereqs for medical school here at sfsu as a postbacc student and i am so happy that it has allowed me to stay in the bay area to do so.
"although i like science, but im not interested in biology."
"so to summarize my second point, i want to encourage people to take an interest in stem because it can be rewarding and if you don't do it then there's a chance you will not have a job in the future."
physics is the foundation science of the universe (though some would argue mathematics is the foundation).
i am a biology major because science has always been my favorite subject.
the question can be subjective.
this level of education is most beneficial for my future and what i am going to be doing for the rest of my life.
"with that in mind, for some reason, i felt i had to attend sfsu to get to where i wanted to go and to learn what i had been missing."
"i subsequently chose computer science because the sciences have always been fascinating to me and i love building and overclocking computers, but after studying cs for a year and turning one of my favorite hobbies into something i have to work hard at, my passion started to die for that field."
"the reason i am here at sf state was, at first, confusing."
"i am here to make new connections with people i work with, which contributes to my personal and career growth."
this is asking for a 150ish world limit and i'm trying to oblige.
"so this class will enhance my problem solving skills right now in life, and later in life."
we were all urged to go to college from the day we set into our kindergarten class and i am now here getting an education to only go to another school and continue my education even more.
during high school i took chemistry and physics and when ever we did some of our labs i found it interesting.
physics is one of those things that happen all around and impacts the world that we live in every day.
"i am here because i need to take this class for my major, mechanical engineering."
the more i learn the more opportunities are available for me.
"sometimes in massive science classes, it can be challenging to have your individual questions answered."
"im currently a prekinesiology major, and i hope to get into the kinesiology program."
"if i'm being completely honest, i'm here because i'm required to take this class for my major."
zhuowa wuphys 112.0101 september 2020reflective journal 1why am i here?
"i feel like i'm meant to do such big and meaningful things in life, so when i'm stressing about stupid homework and readings and such i feel like i get distracted from why i'm here, for life."
i have come to appreciate the thought process that goes into engineering.
after i get my bachelors degree i am going to do a program at uc davis to continue becoming a vet.
i took two years of physics in high school and kind of fell in love with the subject.
its been one year since i last took the first semester of physics calculus base and not gonna lie ive forgotten a chunk of the course but usually the lab classes helps me understand the subject a little bit better and i do tend to ask a lot more questions during labs because i know the instructors are there to help me understand the topics.
"i was avoiding to take this class because even the name of ""physics"" is scary for me."
"in college, i am just discovering myself and hoping to find what makes me happy in the long run and meet others along the way who are in the same boat."
to change or impact the people around me.
"the answer is in no way short or linear, to any of these questions even the most straightforward on, but i don't think many things are?"
"but after coming to the united states, i have kind of started taking interest in physics."
i've taken support classes in the past and it alwats helps.
i have chosen my career path based on this assumption as well.
this is question is super vague.
it also helps us to use it into our daily life.
those worksheets would help me prepare me for future exams and have a better understanding of what we go through in class.
"similar to electrical currents, sound waves travel by a pattern or frequency that is also very intriguing for me."
i wanted to be that person for them so i moved out of my hometown and moved to a different city.
i never took physics in high school i dont know what physics is going to be like but i hope i have fun and enjoy the class.
so i thought it would be interesting to take a science that i have never taken before.
the guy i was next to said he was there because he thought the stars and planets were cool and wanted to learn about them.
i like feeling tiny in this huge world.
im not really sure what part of it though.
i'm here cause my parents brought me here.
i am in this physics class because it is required as a part of my lower division pre req's.
"without science, we would not have what we have now."
i am here also because my hometown has no high school and i wanted to go to college.
"with a stronger grasp on how electrons interact and flow, you can explain why circuits and processing chips send signals through your electronic device, and how the system works together to create computers and many other household items."
"that is how i have entered san francisco state university, overall, i am not regretting any choices i have made so far."
throughout my educational career i have easily succeed in biology and chemistry courses because they comes naturally to me.
why am i here?i am here because i wanted a significant change in my life.
i am here in san francisco because my mother was born here in the city in 1959 and has actually remained here her entire life time.
i was very interested in computerrelated stuff.
i am a senior at state and sometimes i feel like i haven't really accomplished much in the past couple of years.
i'm taking phys 111 112 lab and lec.
"also, it is nice to learn more about physics, but the main reason whyi am here is because my major requires me to take this class."
"although money isn't what will lead me to happiness, it allows me the freedom to do whatever i want."
"therefore, i take this lab class."
"its because im passionate about both the mechanical and the software elements of engineering, and computer engineering seems like the bridge and the best of both worlds."
i believe im here to serve a purpose.
"i came to sfsu not by choice really, after multiple college rejections..."
this far i have gained so much not just from physics but life as well.
i am here at sfsu because i wanted to go to college.
"and because of that i believe the reason we exist is or the reason we are ""here"" is to live up to our potential."
to achieve this i have enrolled in this class to lighten the weight of chemistry 215.
a greater essence of why im here would be because i would like to receive my degree in accounting.
it has been a long road but i will definitely pay off in the end.
this class will help me have an understanding of the topic.
a big goal but it is also what motivates me to continue my daily routine.
"it seems like a daunting task, but i think i can manage."
so i am here in this class because it is a requirement for my major.
"if you ask me why i'm here at this university, it's because it was the right school to choose, but it wasn't where i wanted to go."
i find this question often appearing.
i see why they want me to go to school and i want to make them proud.
i wanted to somewhere not too far and not too close.
ever since i was young i did not really like the idea of school and maybe it was because i was just a lazy kid.
it was really hard to find medical care for him and he often needed it.
"this brings me here to this class, in hopes to learn something about physics that i enjoy and hopefully not dread."
"i want to be as selfless and generous as they were, to care for people the way did."
all these things seem like simple things that we used to everyday but somehow they are a mystery too many people.
i am at school to figure out what my passion is in life by taking different courses and seeing if i enjoy taking those specific classes.
well this question is kind of vague so i dont really know how to answer it.
"then after i graduate, i am planning to go straight into the masters degree."
"however, if to do well in school is what it takes, then i will power through."
"it also helps me improve my math and science skills since they are both put together in stem. this can also help me in the real world since there is a huge chunk lessons that are based on the realm world such as vectors, the motion in acceleration and etc."
"your purpose doesn't have to be changing the world, it could be something as simple as bringing joy to someone by providing your delicious donuts, simply because you owe or work at a donut shop."
i think i am ready to take on physics once more and i at least don't plan on failing.
"i like to believe that people are here to achieve a higher education and aren't here forcefully, whats the point in doing something that you're forced to do or dont want to do."
"initially, i thought of just taking this class at a later date, but then thought to myself, might as well get it over with earlier than later."
my job here is to move forward.
"last year, i left astronomy still interested, and some what confused i did not receive all of the knowledge that can be translated into everyday life."
ever since high school i have always avoided taking any physics class because i was afraid of how hard the class was and failing it.
throughout college i found study groups to be very helpful.
i can barely remember anything about my life.
also the different level of knowledge of students helps me to understand in a one to one interaction questioning why someone solved an exercise in such specific manner.
"anyway, i hope we keep our labs like this."
im really glad i did.
"i think that while having a degree does not guarantee you a better job after you graduate, you can use the resources provided by the school to get opportunities."
im taking this class because i am double majoring in environmental science and civil engineering.
well i am here now because of her and because i need to have a better personal understanding in chemistry because of my major is under the science field.
i had a hard time understanding this material when i was a sophomore in high school and i think the stress and hesitation to take this class stemmed off of my negative experience in high school.
"however, this selfdenying lifestyle has been proven and is continuously proven to be the most pleasant lifestyle to live holistically."
"as a genentech scholar, i am required to take sci courses for all my science majors, so this course will help me retain my scholarship."
i also am not very good when it comes to math and logical thinking long wordy problems.
"that we'll one day be nothing and slowly decompose or go to places like ""heaven"" and ""hell""."
"so after hearing how hard this class is, i decided to finally take a class that will help me do good!"
hopefully i will learn the little tricks needed to get that a in the class.
i have previously taken freshman biology and ap biology my junior year.
i am in this class because i believe the extra help will be good for me.
"it has been a long time since i have had taken a physics class, which is why i was a bit nervous coming into this class."
i am here to take this class because it is required for my biology cellular and molecular major.
i used to watch a lot of youtube videos about space and how crazy things can be in outer space compare to earth.
"i'm somewhat confident in my skills in mathematics currently, but i hope that by the end of the semester i will gain more confidence and not be afraid to ask questions and make errors."
i am in the physics 111 supplemental course because i had failed physics 111 in the past spring semester.
"because it seems like the more you have, the more successful you are."
i would hate to have wasted the opportunity that is life.
i am here even though i really want to be napping outside in the sun or at the beach.
my past experience with science classes is normal deal but with astronomy there a vast universe to explore.
"secondly, i am in college because my mother wasn't and experienced many difficulties because of that."
i'm here to learn about chemistry.
i aspire to fulfill the goals i have set for myself and being at state gives me direction towards my aspirations.
"hopefully, with more effort, i will be successful in this class."
"unfortunately, there's no other mainstream alternative path of the like which is college."
i have also wondered how things work especially how humans and our body function.
i was set on a path with many obstacles i must overcome.
"the world is massive and in reality, most of the decisions made in life are insignificant compared to the big picture."
"sci helped me pass bio 230 last semester, so i know it'll do the same for me this semester for 240."
"i see this as a very existentialbroad question, why am i here in the class or why am i here in general."
i havent taken a chemistry class since last summer at my local community college.
"however, i started to research what a career in that field actually entailed and ultimately decided that i would go for it."
i am here for this class to learn more about biology and to help me in my other classes in the future.
i love lab work and am very intrigued by the work of a pathologist.
this is one of the many lower division courses i need to take before i can start to take the upper division courses for my marine biology major.
all in all im here to pass this class and get on with my dream!
here be in college...
why i am here?
i hope to aquire some learning skills that i can use in my life and studies as i finish school at san francisco state university.
"i answer with, it is my being that gives my existence reason to be."
i am here because this is a prerequisite class for my major in computer engineering.
taking this class gives a hands on experience with problems that can be solved through math and science.
and also because it is related to math and solve problems.
just because i am required to be here doesn't take away from the fact that i do like the subject and use it in my everyday life.
i feel like i am here because i realized that being an author is a very risky move.
"im a microbiology major and this major requires two semesters of physics, with this class and its lab section in particular being part of it."
i will be applying to physical therapy school after this semester.
you never really know what is to come in the next day or so and i happened to learn that the hard way.
i do not want to be stuck in retail for the rest of my life.
i am where i am due making tons of different decisions that all made sense at the time.
it is the foundation of modern civilization.
"so even if i wasn't a big fan of stem, i would still have to be in regardless of what i would think about it."
but at times i dont know.
so far my college experience has been really fun and i enjoy it out here in san francisco.
"i do not regret taking these classes at all, actually i am grateful for the opportunity to be able to take these classes."
i learned physics back in high school and it was ok not really indepth but i did really enjoyed physics when i was in high school.
i am taking sci 227 because i found out about taking sci classes during my second semester of freshman year during a biology course.
"i had just transferred from a community college, where i took o chem 1."
i am even seeing similarities in my chemistry and math class so by taking this class it is strengthening my overall knowledge and helping me reach my goal of majoring in biophysiology.
"will help me safely help people rehabilitate using the movement of their bodies, and various fitness equipment."
"additionally, i get to learn about how and why we learned various discoveries such as moon phases, earth's axis and how it gives us the seasons."
"for example, applying to it to bigger questions like how to the world works the way it does."
"i need these credits for my general education in order to move onto my upper division general education classes and my upper division requirements for my major, which is business accounting."
"this fascination with sports turned into an interest in health and fitness as well, which led me down the path of kinesiology."
"they expected my mother to recover just as fast, or if not quicker than her physical injuries."
"there have been so many hurdles already, and i'm hardly halfway to where i want to end up, but its my commitment to this dream and aspiration that has brought me thus far."
i am here at sfsu to gain the knowledge and experience i need to succeed in life and in my future job.
"of all the sciences, i enjoy physics the most and it's the easiest for me to understand because a lot of the things involved are math related."
physics courses are essential in terms of physical therapy and human anatomy because topics such as vectors and forces can be a good analogy when it comes to the human body and its bones.
also because for labs you have to be here physically otherwise i wouldnt get to go over the material.
my life has led up to college and i have been looking for career paths i could actually see myself working in.
they have been nothing like im used to.
am i here today because i genuinely want to understand and know how the universe was created.
understanding physics also helps me in understand other classes im currently taking.
"i miss my friend every day, and i havent been the same without her."
somewhow i will accomplish that by finding myself learning from others.
i have dreams of traveling the world and trying different foods with my friends.
and it is pretty fascinating to be able to learn more and fully understand why this happens.
i am here because i am required to concurrently be enrolled in this lab class if i take physics 230.
why was i here?
"as a computer engineering student, i have finished my phys 222 and 220 last semester.what impressed me the most was the study of error and precision."
"in the sci class, we do practice problems, and work that keeps me focused on physics."
i really dont like writing about this kind of stuff cause if makes me think about what im going to do in the future and i feel like thinking about the future takes away from the present.
"also, this is my first physics class i have ever taken didnt take any in high school because it never crossed my mind but i took math classes up to calculus 3."
why are we here?
"if i asked myself why i'm here and had no answer, that would make me feel useless and unsure."
"however, i would say that i am here in this class, at this school, and on this earth due to change and my drive to achieve the goal that every human strives to attain which is living a healthy and happy life."
why am i here?i honestly wonder this to myself all the time.
im gonna need as much help as i can get!
stars that are very old and stars that are fairly new.
another reason that i am in the sci course is to get a class unit so that i may be eligible for competition in my sport.
"i know i have taken ap physics in the past in high school, but have struggled along the way and barely passed."
"as an aspiring computer science major, physics is one of the classes that we need in order to even get into the field."
"from volunteering with kids from a young age, i begin to understand how they act around people and also would like to understand more about how to help them healthwise."
"to do what i feel passionate about, no matter what it is, as long as i achieve my higher education."
"having severe anxiety, i learned this is one thing that can calm me down."
i might as well finish doing what i came here to do.
"out of all sciences, i tend to find physics the most enjoyable which is why i decided to take phys 101 and phys 102."
"i should have dropped the class, it was a very frustration experience, but i waited it out because i thought that if i studied enough, went to office hours enough, that i would pass."
"there are certain aspects of physics that i find to be very boring, for example: the math portion of it."
"i did not plan on attending sfsu because of the cost of living, but i ended up coming because it was the only university of 3 to accept me due to the fact that sdsu and csusm have become extremely competitive to get into for local students over the recent years."
"what i do know is that this class, this job, this school, this major are all stepping stones to where i am supposed to end up and that is why i am here."
"i honestly didnt know anything about physics before taking the class, since i never took a class in high school."
"i know now that as of this point in time i am meant to be a good sister, daughter, friend, girlfriend, student and whatever else people might see of me."
"therefore, the reason why i am here is to be a person who listens to others and make them comfortable and happy."
my brother didnt go to college and my parents didnt either as they are immigrants from nicaragua.
i also plan to carry what i learned to my next physics class in the future.
"through hard work and empathy, we not only build bridges, we build gateways into prosperity."
i feel like being present in this class will help me better understand physics conceptually and mathematically.
"although it is good to have broad and general knowledge in order to add more variability to our choices in life, and to understand completely about those choices we make, i feel that it should be considered more from students perspectives on the importance of the classes."
"i really love working with children, thats why i am becoming a pediatrician."
i was afraid that she will forget me one day and i told my mom about san francisco state university is also a college for business.
"i feel like i'm here in life to just sorta live simply, and to see what i can do for others."
"it was hard for me to remember things such as key terms and concepts, and so i'm taking it now because i assume that the pacing is a lot better, and the teaching will be a lot smoother than before."
"in that case, i am very relieved."
it is currently my third year here at san francisco state taking 17 units in order to graduate on time in four years.
i like physics and learning about physics so i am excited to be part of this class and get a better understanding as well.
"i am deeply interested in the fundamental forces that shape our world from gravity, machinery, and even on a molecular subatomic scale."
"though, i feel like the biggest help would have had to have been the study sessions the instructors graciously coordinated and lead for us right before we walked into an exam."
"when i was younger i would skip class often, and i would always feel terrible."
he never said that i asked him a dumb question though.
"the cell biology class was dense material from the beginning, and i felt it would be best for me to join the course."
i am here to make them proud.
i hope the parallel universe me is doing well.
"i also like to play basketball, so maybe physics might be able to help with my shots because i've been getting worse as the years go by."
i also believe that there's not a lot of representation of black and brown students in the stem field as well and i would like to be part of that change.
"i knew i needed help, but i was too shy to ask people for help."
and i think that physics is really important when it comes to research.
i am here because i have to fulfill the prerequisites for my major.
she was kidding.
the technology industry is easily the most neededimportant field our world is relying on now.
i am here because i find astronomy interesting and excited to learn about space and stuff.
i am not a physics major but instead i am a child and adolescent major.
i enjoy learning about how things work underneath the hood.
"i hope to understand why one does what it does, such as gravity and motion."
"(instead of answering, i just drew a picture of a sleepy snake that never left his nest (i.e. displacement of zero)."
i initially was planning on going into athletic training but two semesters ago i decided to go full throttle.
i am always curious to know how things work so to learn about it makes me feel like i am accomplishing one of my curiosities.
in high school i took biology and forensic courses instead of physics course.
i never really considered going to sfsu when i was filling out college apps.
ive always found stars and galaxies to be fascinating and never understood the complexity behind them.
i believed it played an immense role in the grade that i got in the biology lecture and even our lab course as well.
i was adamant about trying to make the planets resources more efficient and make them last longer.
"although i probably wont be needing actual physics for a future computer science job, these problem solving techniques will be very helpful in the future."
"of course, because of my proficiency of theoretical knowledge, i think this class is relatively easy for me and i can do it well."
"even though i had some experience when it comes to physics, everything that i have been learning this semester is all new material for me."
i wasnt paying or doing enough to pass to the class so i ended with a d.
this is also a requirement for my major in order for me to graduate on time.
i am someone who always questions everything and pondering on things your typical person wouldn't and i think its because i am maybe an old soul.
the reason i did not think about taking it at first was because my professor did not explain it very well and i had never even heard of a sci course.
i haven't taken a physics course since high school therefore i'm a little rusty.
im also a big fan of the universe and have lots of curiosity towards why earth does what it does and how this so called big bang created all of life.
also physics ties back to all branches of science.
i am here in united states because my father migrated us from philippines to have a better opportunity and to be able to have a degree that i can have and use my degree where ever i go.
"at pretty much all the medical schools i am looking into i need one year of general physics, general chemistry, and general biology."
"if we pay attention to life, you can see how every person serves a purpose."
now i've been in school for about 5 years now...
it would be nice to have people over and be able to tell them how you designed and constructed such a beautiful house.
"physics can be easy for some people and it doesnt require any effort of trying to understand it, but obviously i am not one of those people."
i know this class is okay to make mistakes because the people around me here are very understanding and they will support you whenever you are in need.
"i am still not completely positive if that is really my purpose in life, or why i am here, but it is what i want to work towards every day of life."
i'm thankful that i don't need to stress so much for not understanding the materials or stressing about not getting help.
"i can see how some labs can be practical for my field, but at the same time i don't ever see myself using mercury lamps or similar equipment in my field of work."
"all things considered, these are all the reasons i am here."
"so i want to always be cautious of the things i am doing, its hard but my goal every day from when i wake up to when i go to sleep is to ensure my actions have positive consequences."
i am here to meet the course requirements needed for my major.
this class has really helped me because i feel like since the teachers are past students of that class they help us to understand the ways of how the class is carried out and also how we are supposed to expect from the class.
this is why i am a biology major.
"the first three years i was an apprentice, and i learned a lot about my trade."
physics is mother fucking hard as shit.
"i think on a bigger scale, the reason why i am here at sfsu is because i knew i wanted to expand my worldview and decided that going to a school far from my hometown would benefit me because it would allow me to interact and meet new people and give me the opportunity to make longlasting and meaningful connections."
"it's close to home where i can commute easily, i can work a lot if need be, but i also get some of the same experiences of being in ""real college""."
but to get there i have to finish my ges here and learn the basics and underlaying knowledge of the world of biology.
"i am here but at the same time, i am not really here."
i'm taking astronomy because i realized animal diversity didn't have a lab.
"with these tools that i hope to sharpen up during my time here at sf state i would love to enter the medical field either as a physician assistant, lab researcher, pathologist, etc."
"i have never spent too much time in sf to know the area, but through sfsu i am very excited to get to know the city and continue my journey."
"without educati on and a diploma to show for it, it is difficult to find a stable job and have that financial freedom."
my major is environmental architecture but i am currently following the civil engineering path at state.
the reason i chose to major in mechanical engineering is because i hear that engineers get quite a nice amount for their payroll and i also think that learning about the building process of the many mechanical devices we use in our daily lives is interesting.
"to be quite honest, this is not the way i want to live."
i also love science because i enjoy seeing how things work out out.
"overall, i will say im looking forward to the class and learning the material, especially the lab portion given it should be significantly smoother then my physics 1 lab went due to different grading policies."
hopefully i can use the labs to help me fully understand the materials we are going over in the lectures.
i'd often ask why they had that disease or what affects does it have on people.
"for my major, i am mainly applying it to the movement and physiology of the body, how it move and perform exercises correctly and without hurting ones self."
since taking the physics in high school i have viewed the world a little differently because everything around me relates to it.
i am here because i still want to continue my educational path forward even through this difficult time.
some of these stars can be dangerous for human beings as they hold a lot of toxic gases.
"coming to this physics lab keeps me on my toes, and i never know what to expect when i show up, but its usually a virtual lab."
"""why am i here?"" this question is super general but i'm here for a lot of reasons."
i feel like purpose could change during different stages of live.
this class will give be a better opportunity and chance to do well in bio 230 because of the extra clarification on terms and topics that i cannot fully understand in the lecture.
i have never been good at it either.
"i am excited about that, but i bet its still as hard."
i believe that sci 111 will help me get there.
"not going to lie, i fooled around a lot in the beginning and it took me quite a while to find my footing."
being able to lift as many worries off of people is something that i find joy in.
"i've enjoyed it so far, nothing has been too out of my grasp but challenging enough to make me think a little."
to not get a degree now would be a monumental waste of both effort and funds.
i am in this class because i need assistance in my chemistry class.
i am also taken sci for ochem and figured having the extra help cannot hurt.
overall i just want to learn everything that i can that will make it easier for me in the future.
"biology has always been my favorite, mainly because its about life, and that interests me more."
i wanted to be the one doing the procedure not just watching.
"but if i could think of another reason as to why i am here in a kinesiology lab taking the lecture as well, spending 4 days a week learning physics, it would be to understand how things in this world work and they interact with each other."
"i understand that physics is an important part for computer science as many of the hardware tools include a lot about physics, circuits and many other related topics."
this school is pretty nice and i like it here.
the way that matter and energy interact.
then i have my share of families that finish high and then start working.
"especially with weights and machines, physics will be useful for measuring a persons limit and how far to push their bodies while exercising."
i'm here to study hard and retain knowledge which will hopefully translate to an a in the class.
"i am here because i am eager to learn new things everyday, that i know will benefit me in the near future."
im here for one reason which is to learn something new every day.
i am a fan of science and i am upset with all the antiscience bias that the world is seemingly going through right now and the best way to combat that is through education and enlightenment.
since i know how to these classes work as a stem major i look forward to taking more of these classes.
"so far, im enjoying physics."
but i'm thinking of adding chemistry as my minor since i need to take organic chemistry.
i'm in sci 230 because i intend to use as many resources as possible to find success in bio 230.
to keep striving at being a better person each and every day .
its almost simultaneously more difficult and less difficult than the other broad sciences.
it will create an environment that allows for me to feel like i can study.
thank you for reading.
"now that i am here at sf state and in this course, i feel closer than ever to my dreams."
"when i got injured playing basketball, i had a chipped bone on my humerus which did not allow my arm to bend and function as smoothly."
"now on the other hand, i am in this astronomy lab class because i am currently taking astronomy 115 and decided to take the lab tied into that class."
"from my standpoint, humanity needs to find a way to be less wasteful with their resources."
"i try my best to go to my professors office hours and study material i did not understand in lecture, but sometimes i still do not understand."
i think you will be most likely to complete this class the best i can and from there i will be motivated for other subjects in the following semesters.
"in terms of sfsu, i'm here to save money."
"why am i here?i'm here to get my degree, although sometimes i feel as though i've hit a a wall."
i am here because i need to take this lab course in conjunction with my physics 240 lecture.
"however, i refuse to throw life into this meaningless category because i believe theres more to life than the individual."
"i havent taken a great interest in any other subject, really."
"well, for one i believe that i have a purpose, as does everyone else."
"learning physics applied in everyday life even if you don't know it because for example, say you drop a ball that is physics being applied in the real world."
i'm disappointed that i neglected to take the class sooner and now i have to struggle to understand the concepts all over again.
"otherwise, i dont think i will choose this class as a ge although i did pretty good when i was in high school."
"i have never taken a physics class before, so when i was enrolling in physics 111 i was super nervous about how i was going to succeed and do in this course."
my goal is to fully understand chem and all the topics that i am taugh.
i also felt that if i surrounded myself with more like minded people i could see how their experience in this field have effected them.
"but since i'm not sure, ill talk about both."
"honestly, i'm not good at studying physics."
"in my off time, i like to perform music with friends on stage and i have been playing guitar and bass for 13 years."
"i know i will be challenged, but i am determined to try my best to succeed."
but the reason in which i am in sfsu is because i wanted to make something out of myself.
that is what makes up learning.
taking this class because i need to meet sfsu kin major requirement and also my dpt program requirements.
we have to understand some physics knowledge to know better about computers.
i'm never the studious type nor am i the type to believe education holds that much power over someone's life.
"regardless if i get accepted or not the overall goal is to become one step closer in finishing the required courses to graduate with a degree, and hopefully get a good job."
i find it therapeutic to deliberately and thoroughly research a single topic in the lab.
i think this class is required because it enables you to think critically about how things work.
"i hope that in this class, i will improve on my quantitative thinking, and will improve on formulating the work i have done in experiments."
it is either he comes through or i will trade him for someone who can.
my goal is to get a job a biotech company.
i decided to take my education at san francisco state university because i wanted to be more independent.
im in this class because it's a step to achieving a bachelor's degree in kinesiology.
its not for fun ill tell you that off the bat.
"with learning new things, and putting them into practice during assignments, i feel that i will be able to use what i have learned to give back to my community."
imagine the black lives matter movement couldnt kick off if enough people didnt have social media presence to fuel it and share their personal and systematic experiences of racism.
"i had started in sfsu as a prenursing major but that never really was my passion, it was only a career my parents said i can make money in and although that is true i thought to myself that i would never be completely happy with that job because i'll always be thinking about my real passion, which is caring for animals.i chose this school because 1) when i dorm it would be far enough and close enough from my family (we live in san jose) and 2) when coming into the prenursing major, i saw that sf state had also offered zoology so i guess in a way i knew i would eventually switch my major, i just had to have the courage to switch and follow my passion."
to be honest the only reason i am here is because it is required for my major.
and i know that this probably sounds like me sucking up to you or something of the sort.
"the field of medicine is not my dream job, however, having been able to work in the field as a medical assisting i did enjoy working in the healthcare field."
i like that you are doing the powerpoint and lecture.
im here to be a better student and a better version of myself.
"though its only the second week of class, i already notice and understand how physics is present in our everyday lives."
i chose astronomy lab because astronomy has always been an interesting course to me.
i do prefer physics as i find it rather more enjoyable.
i chose to come to class so that i can learn the material and perhaps not depend on anybody.
i'm also in this class to discover what i really want to do for the rest if my life.
it is also very fascinating to see how physics in today's world is affecting our lives today and what is happening in the future that can possibly benefit us.
why am i here in general?
last semester i took biology 230 and although it was my first semester in college i struggled a little bit.
"but i mean, theres always a bigger reason because i could have taken any other lab class but i went to with astronomy."
"i am taking a higher physics course than the one required for my course, because i don't want to do it for the grade.i actually want to learn and improvise the knowledge that i already have."
i always think if every class on campus took real life issue and had their classes look for solutions to solve them and actually apply them in our city what beautiful change we could see.
"after attending both of the physics classes, i started to think it might not be as boring as i thought itd be."
"however, i did not meet the math requirements and me taking calculous along side these classes was unacceptable."
"i dont regret making the choice, though having so many classes is kind of hard to juggle, it means i have to step up my game and focus on school more."
right now im specifically sitting in sci 115 to benefit my grade and knowledge for chem 115 .i feel that from this class i will be better equipt for tests and quizzes.
i wanted to go into the stem field because i just happened to be a bit more proficient at the course material than other subjects.
it's now for my lifelong learning and application for whats next in my life.
"where i am in my current knowledge of understanding physics, is that after completing physics 111 i really dont feel that i have learned a lot from the course, and now that i am in phys 121, i am keeping a good pace and staying caught up with the class and i am hoping that i can learn just as much as i can online when compared to inperson classes."
i hope everything will be good in this class.
you have to think about how to get to that goal.
it is a good chance for us become more confident in future class.
"for example, body movement or balance is based on the concept of physics."
this class also helps me to develop critical thinking and math skills.
i'm here to feel better about myself.
"however, i must go back to basics and start off with classical newtonian physics first."
"on a more broad scale, i am here at school because i believe that education is the best solution especially if you do not know where or what you want to be or do in your life."
i hope that this lab class will further my knowledge and interest in future physics courses.
university has taught me the applicability of these subjects subtly.
i haven't decided yet but the possibilities are there.
i will not do well in my future classes
i will need to understand physics and its concepts for both of these fields.
"i started coding around highschool as my school had an game development academy that taught you about creating ideas of games, programming, and using a game engine."
my great grandpa lived on pacheco ave about 3 blocks away from the beach and it was awesome as a little kid to be able to run to the beach since i grew up in chico where all we have are lakes.
"when i was small i wanted to know how children were born and as i got older i thought ultrasound was very interesting and could be fun not only that but what better job then to tell people the gender of their baby, which is one of the best news you could give someone!!"
i was a bit scared but i was able to make it work out even by bringing my laptop to the labor and delivery room to get my work done.
im really excited to the rest of the labs.
physics complicates more general life interactions so that i can look at what happens more complexly.
"i am here in this class because first, i had to take it."
i understand material when it is shown to me not necessarily when its written on paper.
its been quite a tumultuous journey now hasnt it?
i had to come up with a different design that allowed me to remove the clothesline when needed.
i study physics is not because how much i like physics and how much i love to study.
i am here because i am an existing result of my two parents who brought light to my eyes.
"however, i am vaguely aware that it deals with motion, speed, and pressure."
i am taking the physics sci class because i do not understand physics for the most part.
i got into the mindset of i am here for a purpose and try to find the importance from everything i do in life.
the reason im here has proven to be a smart decision of mine because this class has helped me learn so much compared to my lecture class.
"reflective journal 1 ""why am i here?"" i am here simply because it will propel me to where i would like to go."
i think that physics is a very intersitng topic that is used in our everyday lives.
reflective journal essay 1 the question why am i here? can be interpreted in many ways.
"also, currently i am working as a drafter and it is the case that i often see my designs come to life."
"at the same time, i need to practice so that i can be prepared for the next class level physics ii as well as my future engineering classes."
as it came down to the wire i accepted san francisco state and figured i could just transfer if i was unhappy.
"i feel like this class would really help me with organic chemistry because i definitely had trouble in my organic chemistry part i, but the workshop helped me a lot."
"humankind creates many inventions such as car, computer, and ai by questioning."
"i am here so that i can graduate and pass all my classes , i dont really have a special reason."
"i understand why this is a required course, as computer science requires a lot of problem solving and critical thinking."
i also would like to practice my lab work and my work ethic and doing labs each week will help that.
"i previously took a physics class in high school, but looking back i didnt really learn much and did not understand the full concept of what physics actually was and the point of it."
"i can also see how calculus has to do with physics so therefore, i can correlate the two subjects together."
its more logic based and memorization and thats something i can do easily.
i am taking physics 111112 because it is a requirement for my degree.
"now, as to why i appreciate being here."
i want this work ethic to continue this way until the end of the semester.
"i have taken calc 2 last semester with the sci course, and i feel like that really benefitted me."
"i am here, because i need this class for a ge requirement."
after earning my bs degree in biochemistry i plan to take the dental admission test and apply to dental school.
"as for this supplementary course, i have only been in it for one class, and i already think it is my favorite class."
"i guess it's called the ""american dream"" that people would believe they'll be able to achieve."
"i'm taking this class, physics lab 112 because it's a corequisite for general physics which i have to take for my biology major."
"also, it must be really cool to be able to experience all these new construction materials or anything related to it in first hand."
"another reason why i'm here is because of my parents that decide to have two kids and that i ended up born as the second child and therefore i am here on earth and have an older sister that sometimes really annoying, flying far away from home to pursue my education in the states and that will be another reason that i am here in the states."
"this semester the hardest class for me is ochem, and the rest are up or ges."
i am also curious about other sci classes offered for the past semesters and if there are classes that are offered for non science classes.
the only way to learn and understand this is to first get the underlying themes and concepts that revolve around movement...
"extensive research and math was not something i understood why i had to be so knee deep in when i first began my years in university but i have come to realize that al these subjects (math, sciences,physics) is what i have to do in order succeed since they usually go handinhand."
the thing is ive always liked math and science but i never really had a clear path of what i wanted to do with it all.
i have a desire for learning and dont just want to understand the math but the actual thoery and what it means.
this is really all i can think of right now as to why im here and additionally how its been going so far the past 3 weeks.
this is a serious question that i've never thought about until recently.
i just needed a break from where i grew up.
without the previous sci course i most definitely would have struggled more and possibly even failed.
"i am in school because i seek to build a foundation of knowledge in my interests which range from english, philosophy, and now political science and astronomy."
not only that this class is a requirement for my major but also physics is in fact come to play in our everyday life.
i hope this physics lab and the physics lecture will help to boost my self confidence.
i don't want to give up because this is something that i really want to do.
im currently in my fourth year which wont be my last since i will need another year to pass my majors required classes.
"in terms of the course so far, it can be challenging."
"as we discussed in our first lecture and the first chapter of our textbook, physics helps us to understand the work around us, so taking this class will definitely bring me some skills that will help me understand things in my day to day life."
"in regards to sfsu, i thought i was here just because i wanted to get away from my hometown and move to a bigger city, but the more time i spend here the more things i find i enjoy within the campus."
"honestly speaking, i have no idea."
"i really enjoy drawing, so i think drafting plans in engineering is something that i'd enjoy doing."
a degree in civil engineering will do more than just give the company credibility but also allow it to expand into territories other than just plumbing.
"this semester i am taking 18 units, so i have a lot of homework and classes and exams but taking sci classes will help me get less stress about my exams and homework."
i am here to prove everyone who doubted me wrong and display what i am capable of.
science interest me the most and i have always been interested in science since i was in elementary school.
i think furthering your education if possible is a very important thing.
i have learned so much already in the few weeks from my classes and it amazes me.
"examples such as how far, long and etc something is."
"even though i know i made mistakes, i was able to answer every question on the test, and didnt completely panic."
while attending school and pursuing higher education i believe that i can help people by teaching them the foundations of healthy choices and habits and how to maintain health in order to achieve confidence in their own frames.
the reason why i am here can be because of many reasons.
even though i have to take this class i really enjoy learning how it is that the world works.
"but yet, i am still persevering to become the mechanical engineer i am setting out to be."
not only that but i also want to excel in bio230 and do the absolute best i can in not just that class but all of my classes.
i started to lean towards criminal justice because i come from a decent military family and was thinking i could find my way into a federal field.
i have been working on my prerequisites since my freshman year in addition to my major coursework.
i loved animals so much that i couldn't think of anything else that would make me happier than to work with the animals that i loved so much.
i have no experience studying chemistry in high school.
i know that physics can be quite a challenge for me but i will not let it stop me from trying hard in this class.
this is a great opportunity for me to do that and prove to myself and others that i am capable of anything i set my mind to!
i was born and raised in san francisco i love this magical city.
i feel this class can give me more one on one time with the teachers in the class so they can help me better understand what i don't understand or what i am struggling with.
"they've always told me throughout the years that they don't want me to end up like them, having to work everyday and be exhausted just to make a living."
why am i here (sci 121 and san francisco state university)?
"whenever i see weird and very complicated numbers that requires long calculations, right then, i give up."
taking physics lab makes me realize that our daily life is related to physics.
this class is my extra effort in trying to be a better student and set me on the right path for college.
"under standing motion, gravity, velocity, rebound, etc."
with that broad idea i could claim that becoming an engineer is impossible without the knowledge of physics and that is the reason why i am here in this class.
i dont believe that i will use anything physics related in my future but getting the knowledge will be helpful.
"my dad also works in aerospace manufacturing, so its kind of in the family."
i believe this had a large part due to my professor having a thick accent.
"""why am i here?"" for starters, i am here for a number of reasons."
"as a bio major these science courses have been really tough, the two sci classes that ive taken so far have been sci 215, and sci 240."
there are probably more factors that go into it that i don't know yet.
i do know that physics can be really cool especially in labs.
"i dont have any prior experience with physics classes, but i am looking forward to learning and strengthening my knowledge on this subject."
i'm also at school today because i have calculus 3 in the morning that i need to be at so it's convenient to come to this one on tuesdays.
they were forced to learn a new language and adapt to the new environment around them.
why am i here at san fransisco state?
i am here because of covid19.
i am here because it is part of my prerequisite for my major and because ive never taken physics before so this would be something new for me.
earlier in my life i wasnt able to make enough money or time to go to college.
"if it werent for my older sister, my mother would have been admitted in the psychiatric ward for further assessment."
"eam im 'suus' quoque satis, aderunt per ipsum et related agro suus 'ridiculam satis ingeniarius, qui non est cogitare de math et scientia praecipue bonum, quod aliqua sint duo placita background ipsum."
i am also taking this course because it is a requirement for dental school.
also i am here because i applied to san francisco state university and like here but not so much the commute because it i take the ferry and the metro about one hour and forty minutes till i get to school.
"the first and most obvious one is that these fields are needed on more than just a daily basis; they are the basics of life itself, being literally any and every where you can possibly think of."
i decided to change my major to zoology and i'm working towards a minor in chemistry.
"im majoring in environmental science, hoping to learn more about our home and how we can help repair the damage weve done."
"throughout my life, learning about new things has been an interest of mine, and i hope to continue this for as long as i live."
i am confused n what my purpose is in life.
"not only does it bring certainty but if you strive and work hard at it, anyone can be in it.there is no need to be gifted physically or nothing of that sort."
"i don't know why i'm here in this life, or what purpose i'm fulfilling; honestly i'm just rolling with the punches."
physics is an interesting concept that i often overlook due to the equations and complex idea behind it.
i am hoping to learn as much as i can so i can apply it to the real world problems i will face as a professional geologist.
he says it makes him feel smart.
the reason i signed up for this class was that it is a prerequisite for my major that i have to complete prior to graduation.
"because it is required, i actually pay attention in class and am interested in learning about physical interactions that we can and cant see."
i couldnt find a different class that icould do earlier and fit into my schedule that doesnt involve a saturday class.
"i am here because i want to ace o chem 2, and i am tired of failing my classes."
"and not just that i just also wanted to get an interesting job that is based on tech ( or maybe a job that is not based on computer science, but at least interesting)."
i also want to see how physics relates to my everyday life and apply it.
i am also here to apply what i learned in my fall 2018 astronomy class.
"it's impossible because you learn something new pretty much everyday.the reason for why i am taking this class, physics 232, is because it is required for my major."
this is important because we will need in our future lives and careers.
i believe that there is always something meaningful that is brought into every class.
"also, we got to go to the planetarium a couple of times and it was great being able to see what that was like."
that was my main reason behind it.
"sometimes i forget why im here, so this is honestly a good reminder."
this made me want to take part of this class (sci305) to further improve my knowledge and understanding of the course.
i decided to become a biology major because of my senior year of high school.
this course seems easiest out of all other science lab courses.
i'm taking this class because i've never taken a physics class before.
its a pretty amazing school so i figured these majors are close enough.
i was able to pass the class with a high b. i believe that because i took a sci course before and received a good grade it will happen again this year
sci classes i feel like are the best class to take to be able to understand more in depth on concepts.
"why am i here i remembered when i was a kid i was interested in business management, during high school, i had to do a lot of research about different colleges."
i enjoy helping and taking care of others.
"but i wanna get this degree, so i can get a stable, nice paying job so i can fund a cool hobby..."
"i also have not taken a math course since freshman year and did not need it for my major, so i completely feel different worrying about a math exam which was not one of my concerns for the past three years."
i am glad that i took this sci course because natalia and stephanie really ensure that we understand the concept before they move on to the next topic.
im in sci to better my understanding of physics.
i chose to be here because i love being a person that people can look up to.
i am taking this course because i have never taken physics before and i have heard that it is one of the most difficult courses that you take as a biology major.
i am here at sf state to succeed and have a better future.
"though i am taking this class for units, i am interested in this topic and have already taken astronomy, which i enjoyed."
"though, as there was a time change i am thankfully now able to be in attendance."
i honestly cant think of any more reasons as to why im here.
the reason im here at sfsu is because im from the east bay and always loved the city and knew right away how i wanted to go to school in san francisco so i could be close to my family and old friends and also because loving both the college and the city that the college is in is amazing.
i believe that to be true.
"i like to think about this question often, daily even."
"even though i am upper division and already have half my units finished, i still have to be at the school for 4 years because of the specific criteria it takes to graduate."
"i am curious and intrigued by how things work and come together, i didn't know how many things actually involved physics."
a question i still ask myself today.
i guess the reason i went into a stem major in the first place was because that's where the money is going to be in the future even now in present time so many people working stem jobs get paid really well.
and from there it was kind of just about finding a stem major that sounded interesting.
"i hope that by being here, i am able to improve my learning experience while partaking in something new."
but i need the class and i will do my best to complete it although learning science stresses me out so much.
like to be honest i didn't even know what to do after highschool.
lately i have been questioning why i am where i am and i can't seem to find an answer.
"however, the purpose is not only limited to learning, but as well as teaching and passing down the knowledge that i have gathered through my journey."
i am looking forward to the challenges that the semester will bring me.
"so far into the course, i believe its a lot of visualizing, but chemistry is a lot of visualization as well so i believe im ready."
i picked this physics class because this is the most interesting branch of science for me.
so one advice i would give is to study the material outside of the class and be curious about some of the things brought up in lecture.
i ended up really liking what i was learning in that class.
could this really just be a dream and the galaxy that we live in is just made up and the rock that supports our life really isnt a rock at all but rather a dream?
"although i feel that there are many things still wrong about our education system and how college works, i feel that this is where i should be."
well for one i am here because i needed to take this course in order to survive in my current chem 215 class.
"i enjoy expanding my intellectual horizons, and it will only benefit me in the future."
i'm bad at math and physics is math.
"my friends, which some are from socal and others are from here, have made a significant impact in my life."
im 25 so im late in the game.
"last year i took astronomy 115 to understand the actual science side behind time, space, and planets."
i like to make those around me happy or even doing one little thing to make their day.
the speed at which im typing is probably at around 50 words per minute.
i am here because i left my other class early and i dont want to miss two classes today.
however there are some planets that can sustain human life.
this lab can help me in my physics 220 class because i can ask questions and i would get those questions answered.
there are only a few molecules that are dealt with in organic chemistry but they contribute to a vast amount of organisms in the world.
being in the this class has helped me phenomenally with being able to actually grasp the concepts.
huiping dowdell 24 february 2020 science 230 reflective journaling essay 1 why am i here?
"i'm a person of many talents and skills, which is why i believe i was placed here on this universe for multiple purposes."
this is important to learn not only because we encounter gravity and motion but to also learn why things happen.
"i am happy about what i am doing, and the path that i am currently on."
"in preparation for an anticipated third invasion, children, including the novel's protagonist,andrew ""ender"" wiggin, are trained from a very young age by putting them through increasingly difficult games, including some inzero gravity, where ender'stacticalgeniusis revealed."
well see what happens.
"if you dont have the persistence to keep going, someone else is going to take your spot, and get a leg up on you."
im thinking ill have to take some summer online courses but that wouldnt be so bad.
"but it's not a waste of time because i am learning how to learn, learning to take leadership, learning to create goals and achieve them."
"also, astronomy wasn't quite the same as i thought and i found answers to my questions."
"2, modern medical equipment ct, mri (magnetic resonance imaging), xray (xray pictures), etc."
it is hard for me to imagine what some of these concepts look like and i am hoping that my attendance in lab will help me to understand some of the material that i am learning in physics lecture.
i hope this semester will be exciting as previous semesters here at sfsu. thank you
"to feel human, to feel pain, heartbreak, serenity, forgiveness, joy and feel that life is actually so much more simpler than we think it to be."
"being a biology major, it is required to take this physics course and since i enrolled in the lecture then i also had to enroll in the lab section of it as well."
although i find physics interesting i wouldnt choose to take it on my own if it were not required of me.
the sci classes give students a chance to get more detailed examples so that the whole class will do it together and thats how i learn best.
however i do hope that i learn a lot about physics because i enjoy learning and gaining new knowledge.
i am also interested in learning how to understand software to make games.
i am really glad that i joined this course for assistance because i usually have a hard time attending tutoring services as i have a hard time reaching out to people for help.
after seeing them it made me really interested in physics or possibly majoring in physics but after starting class last month i realized that physics is actually really hard.
"although i admit that every subject has some relativity to our daily lives and everything we do, i do not feel that every course is deemed to be necessary for your education."
class with a b or higher but we will see about that.
"i normally don't do anything anyway, but i have the possibility of making plans if i wanted to."
i believe that physics is a requirement partially due to the nature of this major.
"something that motivated me was that in chemistry in community college, i did horribly at, so at sfsu i was frightened that it would be the same but i actually did very well in my chemistry classes, and i was a chemistry learning assistant for a semester and my instructor even said i should minor in chemistry!"
"after being in physics 121122 and chemistry 115 for a few weeks, i think that visualizing what i am learning is very important."
my purpose is to better my education and get the knowledge that i need to help me get through life.
sometimes it is hard for me to open up when i do not understand something and often i think that i have to figure something out individually.
growing up i never thought i would go to college or let alone be alive at 20 years old.
"i am also here because i know physics will be part of the mcat, so i definitely need to learn it and reflect it on the test."
my goal for myself is being able to gain either a bachelors or masters degree in kinesiology.
sci 230 really makes things more clear.
labs like this i enjoy the most because i have the opportunity to be hands on with the concepts we learn about in lecture.
"however, since this course is online, i have a lot more time on my hands to focus on my studies."
"i think it will be helpful with zoology when learning more in depth about the physical aspect of animals, like what helps a bird fly or how are fish able to be buoyant."
the reason im here at this university is that i don't want to live in a boring minimum wage job for the rest of my life.
"however, one rings out louder than the rest without getting too existential, that one relating to why i am at sfsu, studying physics in a temporary building right now."
it then narrows down to the things that i find joy in participating in and how i utilize my god given gifts.
i am here with a full schedule because i hope to be able to get a good job and be happy after i graduate college.
"i can imagine it, living in a home with open land for the animals to run free and having the feeling that i help improve an animals life."
"i am in chem 215, because it is required for me to continue my biology education."
this will be my last physics class for my requirement.
why am i currently here sitting in this lab class typing this response?
the worksheets we are given are like a sample test where it tests on what we know or need help on.
"my grandpa and grandma live together for a long time, and my mom was the one who is taking care of them."
"also, the way hollie and julie pitched the class was very interesting."
"i feel more confident under sturners teaching, and with added help from sci i feel confident to at least pass with a high c this time."
im here to get a better grasp on this subject as well as to get help on topics i need more help on.
i love to learn about science and why things in the world around us behave the way they do.
"but, i was interested about the stars and how the universe came to be."
i choose san francisco state university because of the biochemistry department.
this sums up the reason why am i here in this community and how it affects us.
"she had experienced a lot hardship and didnt get too much education, so its my time to finishing her dream and give her a better life in the future."
"it was out of the question to not go to college for my family, at least my asian side, so i knew i had to go to college but i never knew why."
"cars, highspeed trains, planes, ships, warships, etc., are all based on physics."
but i am not really an in depth person in that way.
this lab class is one of the few coursessteps needed to complete all requirements made for my degree which is why i am currently completing this response.
"depending on how things go, i will either finish my computer science degree and find a software engineering job, or pursue music."
"i do believe that a good understanding of physics is a major factor in me being able be a successful mechanical engineer when i do graduate, obtain my degree, and start working."
"i'm not too sure how physics effects my major, and sometimes i question why i even have to take it."
"this phys 112 lab is corresponding to the lecture class phys 111, which are the prerequisites i have to fulfill."
"i was kind of worried about taking 215 because a lot of people were saying that it was a hard course, and that's the reason that i'm taking the side course."
"and i felt that sfsu is a very good school for international students because people in this school are very open to international students, and i dont feel being discriminated as an international student at sfsu.why am i here in sf?"
"its not easy for me to understand a lot of scientific and mathematical concepts, but theyre still super interesting to pick apart and it feels like im solving a puzzle."
what would be the point in living?
i thoroughly enjoy the experiments and applying what i learn in lecture into a real world scenario.
"doing things by hand can cause a lot of human error, but since we know the math we are capable of fixing our errors and redoing the experiment."
"since this experience, i feel that this class is useful and a privilege for those who are taking physics 111."
"it was a big before the exam, going through some mock exams and asking any questions for certain questions that i didn't understand or that the whole class did not understand at all."
i do know someone who works inside of a lab and i hope to get into the internship program for it.
i am taking a sci helper class to better understand what i am learning in class.
"i must continue to work hard to finally reach my goal, and to begin my career helping people."
"i feel like that is something that we ask ourselves everyday, whether it be when were just waiting for lecture to end, or are having an existential crisis, its a question that pops up all the time."
the only issue would lie with me and my motivation and focus toward stem. i am known by those close to me to lose focus near the finish line.
having to do this assignment is a waste of my time and i would much rather be watching a physics related video and write about it than this random unrelated question.
"the main reason why i am here is because it is required for me to take this class for my major, which is computer science."
i feel that the skills that i am acquiring can be used to help people all over the world.
my goal is just to pass this course.
"during the summer quarter, i took an oceanography class and just fell in love with earth sciences."
i am here because i understand that i have the opportunity to exceed the limits that have been placed on me because of my ethnicity.
it sounds strange but the reason i even became interested in space was because of rocks and minerals.
it can give me a wider understanding of atoms in a molecular level once we get to it and how i can alter them for the benefit of others.
im also here to see if i enjoy being a stem major or if im just in my major because i think it will give me a lot of skills that i can use to go and get a well paying job.
physics is especially important when understanding the structural mechanisms of geology.
"on the way, i hope to also make connections with the student body."
i never feel repentant to enrolling the lab class.
"i do not plan to major or pursue the study of astronomy, but selected this lab because i took the astronomy intro class my freshman year with chris mccarthy."
a career in the medical field as a cardiothoracic surgeon is what will make me the happiest.
i normally take between 1822 units a semester.
now the school season has started back up and some schools want kids to come back to class while others are doing distance learning.
im here to learn from all of my classes and carry on the knowledge throughout my life.
"it isn't just due to the fact that they're helping me financially, which of course i am exponentially grateful for, but its more than that."
im here to become successful and try to ace this biology class.
i am in physics ii (phys 122) because first of all i am a premed student.
i was always used to being around people who had chosen majors in the medical field that their parents wanted them to do and none of them were passionate about what they were learning.
i am here because i am a microscopic element in the chaotic cosmos.
i am a little bit worried about my performance in this course but i can't really get around it.
the sci class will be a great help this semester as i learn more about physics.
"in addition, i think this class will help with critical thinking and logic development, for example, if i get some number from a calculation, does that number make sense as a solution?"
"while the city definitely has its flaws, choosing to move here instead of staying at home to attend community college has been the best decision i have ever made."
they want me to have a better life than they did in which i appreciate them so much.
"i was constantly distracted and didn't really understand what was going on, along with the fundamentals of the class."
i am here at san francisco state university because i am pursuing a bachelors in kinesiology because i am looking forward to attending a physical therapy program.
"i did okay on the first quiz, but that was because i prepared earlier."
i am not new to physics as i took it during my senior year in high school.
"also, my purpose is not consisting of one single thing goal, but its more of a set of things."
this is why i'm here.
the reason why i chose to come to sfsu is because i love the weather especially when its dark and cloudy.
i think this question is super broad and can be taken in different directions.
"but at the same time, i am very interested in physics as a whole."
i want to learn all there is to astronomy because our world is all about astronomy.
i am taking this class because it is one of the prerequisites for my major as well as introduction physics two.
"from what i understand, the us is currently going through an industrial revolution, and if you don't work in stem, then there's a chance you will get left out out of the job market."
"i believe i was able to achieve the creation of many paths for myself through my passion, dedication and hard work to the art of filmmaking."
like why i am here in this class or why i am here at this college.
"even thought, there are too many painful memory remind me, but i like that felling which i can go on in my real life."
i am not sure what this question specifies about so i will talk about general places where i am at.
"why am i here, was a huge question that i asked myself when i was a first year at state but the question backtracks itself to a series of answers."
"as for this time i hope i can learn physics and enjoy the labs like i did back in high school and get a better understanding of physics, which i struggled to understand back in high school."
that is why i am here.
from this class as a whole i really want to enjoy the experience and have it better my understanding of calculus applied to physics.
i also decided to attend college is because i believe having a degree would be useful for the future.
"in a more literal sense, im in class to make sure i do well in classes and pass the course."
"i've heard a lot of answers, but the one that stood out to me was leaving a legacy.what kind of thing do you want people to remeber you as?"
looking back at last semester i could have tried harder to earn a better grader in that class but it didnt happen.
living in a low income area of oakland made certain things to comeby.
i am in this sci class because physics is a new subject for me.
i am at san francisco state because i wanted to further my education.
i previously attended the university of arizona for two years but was unhappy with how secluded i felt there.
it is and has been my greatest passion since i was little.
i am also here to learn about physics.
i am just a biology major student who needs to take a physics and physics lab to fulfill my requirement.
ahries julian physics 102 reflection 1 why am i here?
"that dream job being a sports agent which, will then allow me to start my career and ultimately starting my next chapter in life."
"however, in the beginning of everything, my initial purpose is to follow my dreams."
right after 12th grade i knew i wanted to major in it.
i've seen a few astronaut movies like the martian and the one with matthew guy who's in a bunch of movies.
"so, i do my best, but obviously i'm a teenage girl and i can be a little brat sometimes."
plus the professor i have doesnt really teach very well and his accent doesnt help either.
in all honesty i am trying to build a better brighter future for myself and i believe that being a stem major can greatly influence where i'll be in 510 years.
i hope the research goes well and that everything works out.and if you know the movie promare......
"by enrolling in this sci biology course, im learning to apply lecture concepts onto real world applications."
"as for the philosophical side of this question, i wonder that all the time."
"i'm here because i want to be a nurse and help people with their needs, and so that i am able to support myself without having to worry about how much rent is going to be a dent in my wallet, so that i can learn as much as i can, especially in university where i have access to knowledge and resources that i may not have again."
"i feel pretty rusty about my skills in physics due to haven't taken one in a year but as the semester goes on, i think i'll be fine."
i am taking this physics lab because it is a mandatory requirement for my major.
"so i can make the claim i have no choice being here, but i am here to fulfill my undergrad requirements, since its required for my major."
"since i'm working on the prerequisites aside from my major courses, i have been taking overload courses since starting college."
"we have to understand chemistry, physics, and biology for all the science majors and it makes sense because they lay the groundwork for all of life and are all tied together."
marilin amaya i am in this class for the fall semester of 2020 because the physics 2 class is a requirement for my biology major.
"i hope to contribute to that future in ai, entertainment, research, software, apps."
i don't want to be stuck with a major and be unhappy.
"so far, i have noticed chemistry and physics have some overlapping topics and informations which is interesting and can be helpful to understanding one another."
last semester i took physics 111 and i didnt think it would be as hard as it was.
i have so many questions that i hope get answered but majority of them that i am asking do not have a a solution to them.
"this question can mean a lot but the way i see this is as is, ""why am i here in college?""."
"i dont know where im going with this but anyways, for my future, i wish to enter a career where i can help people, im interested in pediatrics, pathology, and forensic science."
"even when my grandparents only had a small apartment in oakland, they would offer their homes to any relatives who needed somewhere to stay whether for work or running away from their home."
"i am here in this world to be me and well whether i choose to be the best version of myself...well, that is ultimately up to myself to see if i deserve that for my life."
"in fact, i was very much not excited to have to take a physics class, even though obviously it makes sense to have a fundamental understanding of the subject in any other scientific field."
"i feel like i belong here and there is a reason to be here, i just havent found that reason yet."
i was first introduced to it in my junior year of high school.
"and also, im good at astronomy when im in high school."
i am here because i really love biology.
"i am taking this class because i decided not to take the sci support class last semester, and i should have to help me better."
unfortunately the courses i found through ge as well as a couple that pertained to my major were in a word: lackluster.
i have a pretty good background in chemistry.
i love college especially everything that it has to offer.
i'm hoping the concepts won't be too difficult to understand.
but i really want to learn somethings that i can take outside of this class and say woah thats co and want to teach someone else.
"i like to learn about how things work, i think physics is one of those branches of science where you really learn the purpose of how mechanical, theoretical, and even practical scenarios meet and can potentially explain the world."
it's something that will help me for my chosen field and hopefully give me a new view about physics and other scientific subjects.
"but, on a broader scale, i am here dedicating my time and resources to this class because it was ultimately my choice."
im here at sfsu after trying several different disciplines at two different community colleges.
maybe i am here because there is something important that i need to do with my life.
"then i wondered why i love machinery, and realized it was because i loved cars."
i am looking forward to learn about physics in your class.
i find myself asking this question all the time.
i feel like i have asked this question to myself a lot of times but never had the perfect answer.
"which sucks because to be educated you have to go to an institution, take tests that cost money, pay for college applications, and all that hard work needs to be done because to be successful in america you must have a degree."
"furthermore, this class will help me in trying to approach problems more logically so that way i don't get frustrated and stare at the problem for a long time."
it depends on what the here mean to me.
"so i chose computer science, it still pertains to computers but there's less course requirements and it seemed like i might be able to finish in 23 years."
"it is not like i don't have any interest at all either, i know how physics is quintessential to basically how our entire world works and understanding physics gives us a key to a better understanding of the world."
i am doing this course to be able to have the prerequisite for the next course in line in my degree.
i do not belong here is what i tell myself.
it also promotes the way you proceed physical experiments and labs note.
there is no telling what type of experiments we are going to do and what we will learn.
"besides, i am confident that this course will gain my knowledge."
a lot of this understanding comes from my professors pointing out and explaining why we are taking that course and how the different majors related to the course tie in.
another reason why i am in this class is that physics is a big factor on civil engineering.
"i want a job that doesn't necessarily make me happy but does in fact make those around me happy whether it be with the product i help produce, my work ethic, or my personal actions."
"in all honesty sf state was not my first choice, as a matter of fact, it was my last choice because it did not have my desired major."
"the lecture class also doesnt really suit my learning, i need more of a one on one environment for true absorption."
this is why im here.
another reason why i am in san francisco state because some of my high school friends were also planning to attend the school.
this is ideal for me because i do not want to waste more time and need to obtain a bachelor's degree.
"this is a streamofconsciousness, that means i will not be graded on the choice of my words."
so it was almost a no brainer when deciding what degree i was going to pursure in college.
they put me in this world even though my mom always said she could have dropped me off at the fire department.
well because i thought it would be easier to take both astronomy lecture and lab simultaneously.
i learned that every object has gravitational force do to the earth.
"so, pretty much the reason i am taking sci bio 240 is because it actually improves my learning and helps me understand the concepts of lecture and lab."
i have two dogs that is so anything for and when theyre feeling sick or in need of help it hurts me to know i cant do anything to help and im sure many people feel the same way.
but thats just one example out of an infinite amount out there.
"i always do the best of my capabilities yet i do allow myself to take a breath, when needed."
"with this pandemic going on, it has influenced me to push myself to continue what i am doing because i have a lot of time on my hands to get things done."
my surroundings and people close to me have been my biggest influence on why i believe this is my purpose and why i am here.
"in middle school, i wanted to be a marine biologist and help sea creatures have better care in zoos or aquariums."
at the end of the day i just know to keep my eyes ok the prize and the rest will come along.
"""why am i here?""i am here because i want a lot of money in my life."
being educated and being able to see things from different perspectives is also a big goal.
"i am here, but i really want to go back home to san diego and chill chill on the beach and eat carne asada fries."
"so long story short, i join this class in order to one day help design and build the first affortable submarine car."
"i believe that is why i am ""here."""
"with that being said, i find it important to take an hour of my time to attend this class so that i may fulfill my goals for physics."
"i went to her office hours but everytime i would go, she would talk down upon me, so i stopped going after about 4 visits and went to carp instead.unfortunately carp wasn't too helpful because the tutors didn't really know what we were learning in class and therefore, even after looking at my notes, didn't really teach the concept to me."
"i am taking this science course because the first 2 weeks of organic chemistry, i had a few panic attacks and was extremely worried for how i will end up doing do in the course."
"for me to learn a concept, i have to do something that shows me how it works."
:) roberto ramirez.
these problem solving skills that i will develop in both the physics 230 seminar class and the lab class will be very beneficial to me and my future aspirations.
"i knew that california had good schools for that, and also, because of my g.i. bill, i actually get paid very well while i attend school in this city."
"however, at least there are some advantages to online learning."
i prefer biology and chemistry.
"i tried computer science because that degree had more potential out of a four year to make money right away, but when i was in computer science class i realized i had no passion for it."
here are the additional words i need to meet the word requirement: mary plays the piano.
going to college and getting my degree will help me in trying be a better version of myself and in trying to secure a better a future.
i am here because i made mistakes.
"i am here for myself, as i knew i wanted to be that example i never had."
i just hope the lecture and the lab matches.
"i would question why i was here before because i didn't have a sense of belonging in this environment but i quickly put those doubts to the side and instead of doubting why i was here, i made it more of words of encouragement."
i can see how it may relate to my major.
especially because math is not my strong suite.
"initially, i didn't know why i am here or what my own purpose is, perhaps it is because i am afraid of my own expectations."
"i really regret not taking advantage of the sci class last semester for chem 100, however, this is a new semester, and i am ready to learn."
"in this course i hope to also refine the skills i already know , like writing good responses for labs online ."
as a human being i was given the chance to experience what life exactly is.
i was never the best at math but i will do my best to learn everything and get the a i want.
"after i talk to the advisor he tell me if i need graduate in sfsu i should take a class satisfy with the sfsu general education then i can graduate, so i still have a lab class didnt take yet, so i choose the physical lab class, so this explain why im here in this class."
there are times where i switch them up and get the problem completely wrong.
"after years, i have been inspired by some speakers as to the influence that a scientific education can have."
i am here because this is one step closer to my dream.
"also, ive heard that chem 215 is more challenging so i thought that taking this sci course would be helpful."
i am currently a kinesiology major so i can transfer into the nursing program either here or at another school.
it is also a great course for mastering the information in bio 230.
i am expected to carry on both cultures to the next generation.
"nonetheless, i make sure to always pick up the slack and keep track of it because you should not drop the slack, especially in engineering."
i enjoy coding because i enjoy the feeling of solving a problem.
it is a universal language.
apart from this class being a requirement for me this class is pretty interesting.
"the class is much easier than i expected it to be, however its only the first month of the class, so its bound to get harder sometime soon."
"physics explains motion in my opinion, and motion has everything to do with our lives every single day."
"another reason i am in this class is to get a better understanding of the world, so i can do better in the future with the subject that i have had issues with."
"so far i am confident in my ability, and am keeping up with the class."
"i always thought it was funny, because throughout school some of my friends and classmates would choose classes and professors based on either wordofmouth about which professor was easy and which was difficult, or through a service like ratemyprofessor."
"it's important to me to not just succeed in this class, but excel."
to be able to look at the start and know why the universe is what it is and is continuously expanding.
"i think that using this as a class to study the material will make the homework easier and less of a ""chore"" to do."
"however, i am also very interested in what this class will give me."
"i am here because there are so many things to accomplish, yet there is so little time."
little things like that showed my curiosity basically in the little things.
"in addition, there is so much to research and learn with physics that there is no limit to learning."
sci courses are super helpful and really do allow the students to understand the material from lecture much more than a student who isnt taking this course.
i have a curiosity that i want satiated.
being there really pushed me and helped me realize how fortunate i am with the education opportunities that i have.
"i think as i grow up, i'm starting to come to a better understanding of what my purpose is here on earth, but i do not completely understand yet."
i enjoy school and its not typically something i am forced to just do.
this is my first time taking a sci class so im happy to get the extra help and get a boost to my gpa.
"in astronomy, you get to deal with space, stars, and galaxies, which is all kinds of stuff i find more fascinating than chemistry or biology."
i think the reason that i am at this physics lab are more than one.
the next thing i know i'm out in the real world.
"""why am i here?"" is a question that runs through my head surprisingly multiple times a day whether it be me exploring the bay or walking to my classes."
thats why im here right now.
i hope to graduate from sf state soon and quickly become a physical therapist.
with having all those benefits i had to sign up.
"while physics may not be that related to computer sciencesoftware engineering, it does help me improve with my math skills, problem solving skills, and critical thinking skills."
i'm also taking physics because it directly relates to what i want to learn.
"i am student name, and i am an international student from india."
i am very thankful for where i'm at today and very thankful for the lessons god has taught me.
like you stated in i believe the first lecture class i am part of the class who took this class because it was a requirement to move on to further upper division classes.
when will i ever be using these subjects as a zoology major?
"i did a lot of research on different science careers that interested me, and i have finally come to the decision of doing pathology."
my dad owns his own plumbing company so i feel that getting a degree in stem could help me put the company over the top.
"if i understand the mechanics of the physics behind a car accident, i will be able to better assist my patients and help them to the best of my ability."
"though i need this class for a prereq, i have enjoyed taking physics in the past and i hope to share this positive experience with this class as well."
i am here for a big reason to prove to everyone that i was going to drop out of college after i got pregnant my second semester in my first year of college.
"so far, i have taken chemistry and heard about physics but, i never thought i would take it until i saw it was a part of my requirements for graduating in my major."
their goal might be to save up money and buy a car or to buy clothes to go out.
i'm not entirely sure if i want to remain in the science field and i'm hoping that i'll find a reason to either stay for leave as i explore more classes.
i also learned how the three types of newton's law work.
it is my first time taking a physics course so i am very excited.
so i hope to be able to learn how to create the equations from real world experiences from this class.
"i spend studying for physics around two hours per week which slightly less in the sci. therefore, i study efficiently in the groups and get extra credit while attending those classes."
"i understand that this course will be difficult, but that brings an exciting challenge because it would make it that much more satisfying given that i do succeed."
"at times the idea of science doesnt make me happy, but i dont know if its science or just the amount of work."
"meaning if i don't pass my physics class, i will be behind on my plan."
"but thankfully we usually finish pretty early which is a plus for me, because i dont know if i would be able to focus"
i have a heavy course load this semester so taking this course will help me in a way lessen the amount of studying i need to do.
"eventually, i came along."
i am always so eager to learn new things weather its from a biology class or philosophy or physics.
it is been a while since i took physics and i only remember so much about the subject.
i hope labs will also let me apply on a daily basis.
i find sci classes awesome because you dont really get shy to ask questions when your really confused about something.
"i know i'll need side projects as a computer science major, but i feel like acing this class would just..."
i am here in this city because of all the schools this most likely had the best tuition rate and most appealing place to live.
and i have been surrounded by friends and family who do have other animals as pets.
i feel like that is the only career i have had my heart set on.
this class has been a challenge for me because i am weak in precalculus.
with computer science and software engineering it will allow me to not only be logical but to be creative as well and to execute ideas i have.
i am here because i know i can understand with a little extra help.
"i am usually a shy person, so being able to speak to others in the class brings me out of my shell."
"i have never taken a physics class before, and i am very curious to see what this subject has to offer."
i was able to pass her class and being asked to be a la encouraged me to believe in myself and believe that other classes wont be as hard as i thought they would be and to give any sort of help a chance so that i could do well.
"i am here in this phys111 lab to learn more about physics through physical, on hand activities and experiments."
well at the moment i'm here to pass this class so in order to do so i'm here to take a quiz and write this reflection journal.
i also feel like it was a good idea for me to take this class because it will help me understand physics a lot better.
"after this semester started, this class was a little different compared to what i thought this class would be."
physics will help me understand the study of kinesiology better.
"i have learned that 305 is truly a fundamental class for engineering, and i am thankful sci305 was born."
ive been thinking about that a lot these past couple years.
"so, why is it exactly that i'm here, i think it's the charm of physics and math combined that attracts me, and also the class environment as well."
"i was able to finally get good grades, even in the classes that i wasn't good at and just feel comfortable where i am at."
"i am here to explore career paths but mostly, just riding the wave like how other high school students graduate would be going for."
"if i miss a day lecture, i feel really uncomfortable since i will miss some important information."
"helping me be in a smaller scale room with other peers that are as well trying to learn the same material asking and getting questions, we all found confusing answered."
"i am genuinely interested in how this works, but i don't think that would be enough for me to grab a physics textbook and try to understand it all."
"i am able to teach the concepts to other people and that makes me learn the concepts more as well because i am recalling them and using nothing to reference, but my brain, on what to do."
in sci115 i believe that i will ask my peers and my instructors questions without hesitation.
i need physics for my major and i have never really been good at it.
"i first chose san francisco state because i was a fashion design major until i changed it to bio last semester, but it was a really good school and city for all fashion related things."
i vividly recall the only time i have ever bsed on an academic test which involved the displacement of a snake.
"in undergrad i was a psychology major, because i loved understanding how the mind works."
"i have always thought about this question, and for a period of time (almost 78 years) i really thought i never had a purpose as to why i am here."
the practice problems help us with understanding since it is a lot more interacting and involving than lecture.
i am at sf state because i want to take advantage of this opportunity that i have to get a higher education.
"it is not easy to obtain this degree, so in order to get this degree i will need to put in hard work."
i then transferred into a 4 year university in southern california (california state los angeles) and completed 2 years there.
i specifically chose this class during the time that it occurs because it was the only class that would fit in my current schedule.
but i am here so my mindset is now to take advantage of the situation that i am in and learn as much as i can.
i think i am here from a combination of chances and choices.
"but anyways thats about it for my way, writing from my stream of consciousness is a bit hard cause i'm like what do i even write about?"
"hi bryce!my name is mariella and the reason that im here is because one its a required requirement for physical chemistry, my major is chemistry, and two i enjoy the concept of physics but i do find it very hard to take in."
"i have never taken physics before, just because when i hear the word physics it personally fills me with dread."
"as unattainable as it has seemed at times, i've trained to maintain the idea that my dream is indeed attainable."
i would like to learn other topics in relation to physics.
i hope to graduate with my degree and run for public office.
i have always dreamed of playing basketball professionally but reality hit in where i am still working on my game while needing to find another career as a backup plan.
school is very rough for my major this semester so i dont feel too happy about my choice to postpone this class until now since it takes up so much time and isnt something relevant to my major.
i am not certain why i am here on earth.
"i have always been interested in space and have loved learning about the subject, but i never refined my interest until college, when i chose to take astronomy as my physical science, which was also a no brainer for me."
"by taking this astronomy lab course, it allows me to experiment and learn about polaris and also how to find the distance of a start and its altitudes and azimuth."
therefore it sparked my interest to learn more about how things works and their relationship.
"well, since i was a kid i have been fascinated with the way things work."
as well as just gaining an understanding of the world and how things work.
im here because i sort of know whats going in astronomy and try to pay attention.
i have an interest in learning physics since i have never been in a setting where i actually took the class and the only prior knowledge i have is from watching the big bang theory and learning from there which is not the best source.
becoming a doctor is something ive always dreamt of and this and being here right now is a path for me to get there one day and be successful.
"my current goal for my life is to be a researcher, and to be honest i really dont know what to yet."
chemistry has been kicking my butt since i first got to college and with that i was really afraid to start my physics requirements.
"to me, physics is also fascinating because it not only explains the structure of how objects function, but it really also explains things like how the double helix is a double helix and why another structure doesnt exist for dna, how light is reflected and what kinds of visible light are truly seen by the human eye, and so much more."
my back is always sore and my arms and legs are covered with bruises and scratches.
if i could live in a specific place for the rest of my life it would be here.
"i'm doing this honestly because i need a job that i am content with, a job that lets me embrace a passion that is slowly burning brighter and hopefully never diminishes."
another reason why i'm here is because of the college experience.
finding my purpose to live is an ongoing thought that i dont think about everyday but is a thought in the back of my head when i wake up every morning.
"if by here, you mean to ask why i am alive at this place and time, then i dont know."
i do however sometimes also have a hard time understanding the concept as i have no idea what's happening.
"after having a successful time in sci both emotionally and gradewise, i knew that it would be advantageous to rejoin a sci class this semester."
"secondly, i am here at sfsu because i wanted to get away from home to learn how to be on my own."
i like having extra practice with problems i expect will be on the exam so having a course like sci will really help me to be more prepared and ready for what the lecture will bring.
i would personally say that after covid started and everything went online last semester i kind of just checked out since i was so used to being in class in person.
i am excited to learn from the experiments we are going to do in the class.
im here because this class is a requirement for my major.
having this class allows me to set aside a designated time every week to better understand topics that we have already covered in the parent course or to prepare ourselves by working on material that we may encounter in the future.
i am here in this class also to learn more about physics because to be honest i feel like i know very little about physics.
i am here for many reasons.
"this is all the superficial aspects of life, the american dream so to speak."
"however, being able to attend the labs every wednesday has helped sharpen my understanding about astronomy and, in ways, has cultivated my attentiveness about our world and everything outside of it that expands to space."
"i wanted to get my writing course outof the way, but unfortunately i was too late on preregistering and all the spots for those classes weretaken, so i settled with physics."
i am a bio major so a lot of my courses through college will be science classes and need prerequisite to read higher up in that field as chem has many different courses but needs prerequisite to unlock them.also i am taking calculus and chemistry and these courses kind of go hand in hand so it helps taking physics to get a better grasp of topics.
but i don't think that's the case at all.
so id want to fund a course that would teach more computer science to kids either in a curriculum or at an after school program.
natural selection and whatnot.
"i like to think that he knows as long as we are in this together, we will make it to the finish line."
why am i here? i am in physics 232: general physics with calculus ii laboratory for many valid reasons.
"personally, im doing civil engineering with a focus on transportation, and i got into the stem field personally for hopes of financial success coming with the degree and due to my fondness of engineering in general."
so why am i here?
i am here because the only thing i want fo be when i am older is successful.
"however, i am also here to improve myself on both physics knowledge and practical problems solving skills."
being here at san francisco state gives me an opportunity to get an education.
so here i am (:
"if you think about it, there really is no true purpose to life except to live and to die."
i thought that this class can really help me hone in my math skills.
i'm here because i'm afraid of failing physics and i'm hoping this class will help me succeed in passing it.
it allows for me to ask questions and have a more oneonone experience with a smaller class.
"for me personally, i have chosen to try to be a positive effect on those who i am connected with."
"i forgot where i read this, but many educators say for every unit you take you should be studying one hour per unit your class is worth."
"this leads me to take another sci class, one for a level up chemistry course than i have previously taken."
why am i here in this school?
im here to break that cycle of people not going to college.
"i am here, in this class for a few different reasons."
i think i'm still on my way of figuring that out as the rest of us are.
"now if the question is referring to why am i attending sfsu in san francisco, ca. i would say that i am here because this city really captured me ever since i came to visit, ive always thought it was amazing city."
i am here because i never took the physics lab portion of the class until now 2 years after taking the course originally.
"at the same time, physics is often involved in our daily life."
"like many, i really hate school but i actually have a lot of trouble with physics."
it was not until someone came in our physics lecture and started explaining the sci course.
i used to be so embarrassed to share my dreams with others because they would shoot them down.
this is no excuse just a realization and current confidence entering a course containing new subject matter.
"with labs, i can 'make more friends' because most of the time when i do not understand a step then its easier for me to ask a colleague rather than the instructor."
physics 101 is a class im taking to complete a ge requirement under the laboratory sciences.
they feel like small little flashbacks when i try to think back.
i really want to be able to make a change in people's lives.
this turned out to be a great decision.
as for sf state i wanted to experience san francisco state.
i am nervous about how i'll perform in this class because i tend to struggle with my science courses.
when i was a junior and senior in high school i didnt know what i wanted to do.
i found it interesting and fun even when it's challenging so science has always been my favorite subject.
i started my first semester of college with an astronomy lecture and i got a taste of being a college student.
"when i was child, i read a biography of galileo galilei."
all they did was sacrifice everything to have better opportunities for their children.
im here because i want to improve my studies in chemistry.
"i am infatuated with space and other planets far from us, so i wanted to further my study of astronomy by taking this class."
ive heard how difficult biology could be and i figured taking two hours out of my day could be the difference between passing the class and failing it.
why am i here?there's a lot of reasons as to why im in this class and in this university.
i think it for sure helps with ones critical thinking and problem solving.
i need because it's required or else i wouldn't be in this particular class.
"a class is more than just a requirement, rather it is a door that leads you to a new understanding of the world around you."
"with this in mind, i hope i am able to apply what i will learn in this class to my future classes and career."
obviously it can help me further my education in the field of science and help prepare me for future courses.
"however, most of my classmates are not good it physics or other science subjects, including me."
"my purpose in life, on this planet, here on earth, at this very day and age is to live to serve others."
"while i know that pre calculus is a prerequisite for this class, she did an awful job at explaining the concepts."
"i was the product of a divorced family, my mother was a bartender, my dad wasnt around much, and all of my brothers and sisters were half brothers and half sisters who were at least 8 years older than me."
i enjoy going into the labs handson and having to be in a collaborative environment.
i am at sfsu because i hated the idea of staying in my hometown of san jose but i also didn't want to move super far away from all my friends who stayed in san jose for school.
"as a kinesiology major i want and need to know how our body moves, the limitations of our body, and how our body reacts or its relationship with the world (such as gravity)."
sitting here in my desk doing a physics lab online is something i never though about and never thought i would do this.
ive accepted that i can do science and that has been a journey all in its self.
"however, i believe i have found mine."
"however, i need to make it through a long and difficult path of schooling to pursue this dream."
theres a bit of resentment because its a lower division course that im having to take on some mixups between my transfers from a previous school but its not really targeted at anyone in particular besides educational administration.
now i am here in this class because i am willing to do what it takes to get to that spot.
"at first, i thought that i was here because i had to be here."
"on the way towards getting a major, i get to take this physics class which will help me to understand the laws that govern the universe."
do we all really have to be working everyday in our lives?
i am confident in my academic abilities as i boast a 3.89 gpa with 135 units under my belt while doing extracurricular activities like being a president of a school club and working 30 hours a week.
well thats why im here
"that is the reason as to ""why i am here""..."
i waited quite some time to take physics in my undergrad because ive had bad experiences in the past and the many times i enrolled in physics the professors i was stuck with were some of the worst professors ive ever taken here at sf state.
"this would cause a sharp pain in my elbow whenever i would do pushups, bench press, or simply bending my arm would result in a cracking like noise."
"there's several reason why i'm here, mainly is because i'm enroll in this class and i have to present in the class to follow the lecture."
i am looking forward to experiencing the interesting things in this class in the near future.
"i enjoy not just knowing that something operates a certain way just because, but rather understanding the underlying factors that causes and aids in the work being done to make something perform the way it is."
i'm not particularly good at math or science and with are my two biggest weaknesses.
i want a better future for myself.
imagine what humans could continue to do if we advance our technology.
"also after my quiz on chemistry 216, i realized that i have to practice more and more and i am lacking in the stichometry when i shouldn't have been lacking at all."
im hoping to continue learning all the great biology concepts and take them with me on my journey to my career.
"despite, all these concepts that is definitely interesting, i feel physics can be sometimes hard to be understood with all the details and mind boggling questions it includes."
what i enjoyed about my previous sci class so much as the exam prep that they offered and the intimate setting of the class.
we have a lot of subjects that we need to cover and this class is another stepping stone towards that goal of being able to attain a degree that i could use in the future.i have the goal of becoming a forensic scientist or to be in some field of forensics.
my major here at san francisco state university is computer science.
i'm here because of prerequisite for my computer science degree.
the advisors encouraged us by letting us know that these classes have been proven to help students get a better grade in class.
sometimes it would just be one meal a day.
"the question of ""why am i here"" can be answered in so many ways but i think that it doesn't really matter why we are here but instead that we are already here."
i believe the small classes that dont seem to mean anything is a lot of knowledge to work with.
"so, i am here because i could not enroll in another physics class and by random chance i ended up in your class."
"i have to be able to see and understand the different concepts which i learn in my different classes not just physics necessarily, but rather all the courses which i am taking."
i am the friend you come to when you need advice.
i am grateful that i am able to be surrounded by classmates that are so passionate about their career choice and so kind in helping each other.
"for example, there are two different organic chemistry teachers right now so some of the other students can teach us about topics we havent learned yet and vice verse."
i enjoyed the class but it wasn't something i saw myself doing as a profession.
"i am here because i want to have a good career, i want to be able to provide for myself and for my family."
i will definitely fulfill my schooling requirements so hopefully i can be the best i can be in my career.
but because i took chem last semester most of the material is still fresh.
"so, i always feel the presence of being at home and someone to be there for me while i am away at school."
"by finishing up this prereq in the summer, i will have an extra spot in my coursework during my time at cmc to take advanced physics and upper division science courses."
its been fun working through the problems and picturing the scenarios.
"i strive to one day become a neurosurgeon, and i believe that my education right now gives me practice and knowledge that will aid me in becoming a neurosurgeon, and just simply giving myself ideas of how physics works."
"but that is the future, for now i need to focus on the present and study well so that i am ready."
"the stem subjects are all intertwined in some way, so knowledge of physics will surely aid my understanding of chemistry and other topics."
tiffany chang phys 11202 912020 why am i here?
"but as much as i hate to admit it, i actually like coming to school."
"due to this, there has always been an expectation for me to go into a stem related field."
i am currently here because i wanted to further my education and study something i actually enjoy which is what i am currently doing.
why am i?
so even though i'm not passionate about physics i recognize that it is important for me to do well in this class and understand the concepts taught.
this is something that i am always contemplating.
"i have relationships where i have taught, touched, and even hurt at times."
im here doing everything i can to make something of myself.
i miss real life classes i don't feel like i'm learning or retaining anything i'm learning through these online classes.
i am also here to provide for my daughter and be around her to take care of her from everything.
i am currently taking physics 112 for many reasons.
"even though i don't understand some of the concepts, i do like physics."
i am very thankful that i have my lecture before this course because i feel it helps me throughout the lab.
i am here because college seems to be everyone else's goal.
i'm here because i am blessed with the opportunity to learn about what i am passionate about.
"i feel that having this course taken, it would because it helps quantify how and why things are how they are presently."
i have never taken physics before so i have no background knowledge.
"i plan on working in the world of cinema since i fell in love with the world of theater and i can create, imagine, and do whatever i want where i'm not bound to the laws of physics."
i also just thought it'd be fun to be in a smaller classroom setting where i can get some additional practice!
i needed to take a lab in order to complete a section (honestly i don't really know most of these ge's) and i didn't want to take the lab for biology so i'm here.
butker is a great kicker and will score for me all season long behind patrick mahomes.
they only have a few courses that transfer over that sf state has.
"i genuinely believe that without a plan, humans would go mad."
"i dont want to get too spiritual, however there are times were i look beyond science and the facts because everything can't all be science in my opinion."
my overall goal as to why i am in college is to become a physical therapist.
"physics is an important subject, and im glad that im here to learn more and get a deeper understanding of the world around us."
i was interested in studying in that kind of conditions because having study groups always helps me to learn contents that i did not fully understand or to notice my weakness.
"everything else feels out of reach, so hopefully, i'll find a reason to stay in science while enjoying what i do"
i am here in this class because it is a pre requisite for my major.
"this phrase reminds me of such purpose, i have learned before in my life that having a goal means everything."
"if i didn't chose to be here, i would honestly have no idea or guess to where i would be now but all the decision making and experiences i've had in my life has led me here."
this is my first physics class i am looking forward to learn and enjoy discovering many new ways to solve problems.
"being apart of sci 230 is beneficial to me because as bio 230 lectures go very fast and indepth on difficult concepts, i can ask for help and review the topics i'm struggling on with the instructors in sci 230."
i truly believe that i am meant to be a successful individual.
the extra practice and small group learning is helping me become more confident with my knowledge of physics as well as calculus.
as i expected this course is pretty interesting and i found out more things that i wasn't aware of.
"whenever i get asked why i am here, it is usually a pretty interesting question to answer."
"my childhood was in arizona, and i moved to long beach, and i noticed that the education systems were not the best."
also it will help me get a better understanding of the law of physics.
although it is a requirement physics is an interesting subject to learn.
sometimes i think to myself that i dont need to be here.
becoming a doctor has been a lifelong dream of mine and i plan on enjoying my journey with amazing opportunities here at sfsu.
"most of the experiments we conducted in high school were conducted as if they were hazardous, but we experimented with nothing hazardous."
i am here so that i can get a better grade on my tests and quizzes.
i am going to sf state because i enjoy the people and love the city.
the field where women are appreciated less and less accounted for when compared to their male counterparts.
i decided i would show up because i believe this class will help me pass chem 180.
"but that takes the work of many, and to begin, you must first be educated."
i didn't put that much effort when i first started taking physics to it became difficult for me to catch up with the content.
ive personally never taken a physics class before and ive heard a lot of horror stories which is why i decided to enroll in sci 111.
"i am learning to become more independent, since i live on campus."
the last time i took physics was my freshman year of high school so i couldve used a refresher.
i see physics more as a quantitative subject and a subject that focus on number and movement.
"physics involves a lot of math, which is one of my favorite subjects so fortunately my like for math transfers over to physics."
in high school i became mesmerized by the cosmos and that is when i decided to achieve a degree in astrophysics.
this is something i plan on doing with my kids.
"i just hope ill get a good grade in this class, i know i will because ill be working hard trying my best to pass this class."
i prefer to do written work over hands on labs such as the ones people do in biology.
"like, why is the sky blue?"
that is my dream and hopefully my purpose.
i hold out hope that this course can maybe reverse some of this resentment towards physics?
i can only achieve this dream if i have an education.
ive barely passed calculus and its also very difficult for me to learn without help from others.
this is essentially why i think i am here in this course.
"quite honestly, it is very easy to fall behind classes because i don't have the pressure of seeing my professor face to face."
the other reason why i chose to enroll in this class is because i do have trouble in math sometimes.
i wanted to take this class because i hope to get a better understanding on majority of the topics being taught in lecture.
the reasoning as to why am i here in this astronomy lab class at san francisco state university is because i am just trying to fulfil my lab general education credits.
why should i care about changing the world?
you learn more when you teach others how to do something or if youre learning by another student who is taking the same class.
this is because math and science has usually always clicked with me and because physics does not click in my head automatically without lots of thinking i become stressed and worried that i will never be able to understand the material enough to pass the class.
i was inspired from him.
student name phys122 journal reflection 1 why am i here? this is an interesting question.
i am here in this class to meet prerequisites for orthotics and prosthetics masters degree programs.
having this extra help will allow me to be able to achieve a better grade for the parent class.
i am here today in class because i want to finish all my prerequisites before taking all my higher ups.
"so, i switched sections and added this supplementary course."
im 'etiam hic ob maiorum consiliis meis: et ego ipse et usque ad superesse.
"cut to the current day, my sophomore year standing, i was able to step back and see the bigger picture."
"to be able to quantify and predict the position, velocity and acceleration of an object is very helpful to prevent collision and accidents."
i am willing and able to put in the time necessary to do well in the course.
"i took astronomy 115 last semester and i found it very interesting, so i decided to take the lab for that class."
our communal understanding of our world has changed because of it.
aya alazzehi am enrolled in physics 122 lab to fulfill an undergraduate requirement pertaining to my major.
"when they were young, they escaped the genocide known as the khmer rouge in phnom penh, cambodia."
everything that we are going to tackle is foreign to us.
"is not that i hate studying, but the fact that i dont love it makes it even harder to comprehend why am i here."
i think to take the physics lab will learn more knowledge to apply to my design.
the average person does not think of how far away or how big things in space are like the planets or the stars which makes enjoy being there.
just in case i changed my mind then i can still save some time if i decided to change my major.i don't know if physics is hard or fun.
i am here today in sci 215 to give myself a safety net for chemistry just in case i don't get around to studying the concepts i have learned in lecture and lab.
i have never taken a physics course and all i ever knew from physics was the information told to me by my friends.
i think i was put here to make my parents' lives better as well as the rest of my friends and family.
i am here because i know that this sci class will help me get a much better grade than if i did not do this class.
"i would say i am not the fondest in the field of physics, but some topics really do interest me and it does help me learn how the universe and planets work while studying my astronomy minor."
why am i here...i am here because i am fascinated with the human body and how it functions and moves.
this makes me happy too.
this is my first physics class i have ever taken and so far it has sparked my interest.
i have yet to take a physics class and i am ready to accept the challenge.
"i find all kinds of science interesting, being able to see the bigger picture outside my own little world."
i am excited to see how the format of this class will be laid out since it is a lab course.
he acquired his thining ability from physics.
"many people struggle with the question of why they are ""here."" some find answers in religion or simply do not think about why they are ""here."" i tend not to think about why i am here and simply live day to day."
one of my main goals is to be able to build a house with a swimming pool on one of the floors because that would be awesome!
i am in this course and in this university in order to accomplish my goals.
"i played the violin for six years and joined my schools choir for four years, but i realized i wasnt passionate about it."
i struggle and don't understand everything right away.
i personally believe that an education is the key to success.
i might eventually change it back and decide on transferring to another school but that is an issue for the future.
gives me a clear view of what i want in life.
"something, i hope to master the study and learning skills, problemsolving skills and to expose myself to new ones as i am planning to pursue in academia and in the career"
i am here because i deserve to be here.
also this gives me the opportunity to meet some of my classmates.
the homework seriously causes me so much stress and its only the fourth week of the semester.
"so if i had to answer the question, i would say im here largely in part because of that librarian but also because of my interests in rocks and minerals as well."
i am gathering knowledge on topics i never gave much thought to.
tutoring at san francisco sate university is limited by the hours and number of tutors available.
i am taking this sci class in order to learn more about organic chemistry.
i am in this specific class because i am determined to get a good grade in my chem 215 class since it is a requirement of my major of biology with a concentration of physiology.
stem is a culmination of all the past research efforts.
i was just stressed and rushing to finish assignments as fast as i could because it was so fast paced and i had to work almost everyday.
i'm currently enrolled in both physics lecture and lab.
i am here this morning because i was very lucky to wake up and start another beautiful day.
"despite me having a lack of enthusiasm for the subject, i recognize without it we would not have the knowledge and skill set to advance the rest of the physical sciences."
"with her earnings, she sheltered many street kids, providing them food, water, even teaching them in her free time."
i am looking forward to learn new things about physics in your class.
"not to mention, i can get inspiration from this sci class and apply it to my sci session for math 227."
"granted, this sounds like a concerning motivation for education, but i must now tell you that i still felt a sense of agency in this decision."
"i do enjoy this class because of the professor, lab instructor, and the overall setting and vibes of the class but im not the biggest fan of physics."
"boiling it down to its bare bones, im here because ive finally solidified what i wanted to major in and have finally made the commitment to myself to go for it."
"as a result, in future we will more invention and scientific ideas in coming days."
to break down and fight against everything that oppresses you shows your strength.
"my first year of taking sci, i really enjoyed it."
i completely forgot about those guys because its like so basic but yet important as one continues to build their chemistry skills as the courses get harder.
i also found interested about how different force work.
"maybe by being here in this lab, i would learn to be able to apply physics to reallife situations."
i am interested in what this class has to offer.
"if i dedicated my self to study more and actually learn physics properly, i know that i would understand it well and be able to apply it to real life scenarios."
i love biology and chemistry isnt my favorite but its easier for me to understand than any other major not in the stem field.
"when asked the question, ""why am i here?"", i immediately think about my degree."
the real reason i am actually here is to learn how to be a better physical therapist in the future by understand the foundations of biomechanics through physics.
the road to success was always college.
i usually am only interested in the courses that relate to my major because those are what are important to me.
i really feel like these classes are helping with our critical thinking.
i hope to change that during my time at sfsu and finish strong with my work and studies.
"i guess i'm here in this class, so i can learn from different people learning skills and opinions of physics."
i am here because it's required for my major and i did not want to take calculus 2 as the first one was horrible enough.
"this is the first time im within a study group that are not my friends, so im still getting used to how to communicate and help my classmates out, because were here trying to understand physics."
however as i got older i began to realize that education is very important.
the concepts are somewhat easy to understand and i can see how the math works.
"lastly, of course most people who work in the stem field get a reasonable salary, which is something that is important in my eyes."
i wanted to get into the stem field because i wanted to work towards my dream job.
i am in this class to learn about topics that i have never put much thought into before.
"specifically, i took astronomy over the over offered laboratory classes because when my mom went to state she took this class."
but i am really excited and nervous to take the class because it is my first physics class ever and i wish it was in person instead of online.
"i am not the best in math and i have always had trouble problem solving, because most of the time i second guess and confuse myself which makes me do bad when it comes to exams."
"it made me remember when i would help my uncle work on his car, or see my grandpa work on fixing things or creating things like his solar cooker."
i'm here because i deserve it and i paid a lot of money in order to be taught by the wonderful professors at this school.
there are things i havent learned and i found last sci class to be quite difficult.
"firstly, i'm in this class because its a part of my prerequisite for my major which is biology physiology and also for dental school."
"i am at san francisco state university studying for a biology degree, concentrating on physiology."
"unlike calc 2 to me where everything feels hard and confusing, so i prefer physics."
"after high school, i was very unsure of what i wanted to study and what career i wanted after that."
"we know some and we don't know a lot which is quite interesting, in biology we know a lot as well as anatomy but what about the universe?"
i hope to learn a lot this semester to prepare for phys 121 and 122.
i also prefer looking at equations than looking at rhetorical essays.
"after going through countless classes and counselor meetings, i was able to obtain my true desire in life and what i wanted to study on was environmental science (possibly in sustainability)."
i would love to understand physics better.
"this question is quite broad however, it will approach it as why am i here in the physics class?"
this limited my university options a lot.
even though i'm a psychology major hahaha.
this class is a mandatory concurrent class for physics 2 with calculus.
i would also like to learn the fundamentals of how ai work and how they come to be like siri and google assistant are narrow ais meaning they don't have the human thinking capability.
i guess i am here because i like astronomy.
i crashed andrew's phys 111 and was in lab section 10 for the past week.
i think being able to apply that into the field of kinesiology would be huge because we study range of motion and the movements of the body.
"hopefully, this class can help me overcome my problems and would prepare me for future exams."
i will be working with wildlife in my career and so i hope i can use the skills learned from this physics class to make logical decisions in conservation planning or tasks i'll need to figure out.
i am here so the material i have learned to have a understanding by going over a lot of example questions and going over practice exams that have helped me in the previous sci classes.
my dad however managed to leave the middle east at a young age to become a pilot.
i am also here to have fun in this beautiful city and make memories that i can tell my kids in the future.
maybe i am here to learn about different cultures and observe life without the guidance of anyone but my own.
i'm here because it's important to be here.
"for one, physics was the only subject in high school that i actually enjoyed studying, mostly thanks to having an excellent teacher (shout out to chris balmy.) secondly, thinking about the mechanics of our daytoday lives has fascinated me for a while, since it ensures that physics will always be relevant, no matter the circumstances."
"this is all for them, and i hope to continue making them proud and give them everything and more."
this includes biology 240.
i transferred from another cl state but they did not have the classes that i needed for my major and so i transferred to sfsu.
i have met the most amazing people and had some really awesome experiences and travels.
"in terms of this class, i am here because i am taking chem 215 and was afraid it might be too challenging as i ended chem 115 with a c, so i would very much like to improve that grade."
so i think that physics with math really get the whole perception of what we are .
i couldn't really do that if my parents were on my back supporting along the way not being able to learn my mistakes.
i am in this class because it is one of the requirements for my major.
i'm a computer science major and i like to get into programming robotics so i think knowledge of circuits is useful.
but i'm looking forward to this class and hopefully learn more trippy universe things.
there are many benefits to becoming a pharmacist like getting to know which medicine is otc and what can instantly help you out or your family.
"not to be cliche, but i think learning is one of the things that makes us human, and i respect and want to be in the stem fields because of that."
"when going into a career where science is involved i think it is very important to know every bit of science, including physics."
"ravi johnson physics 23202 january 28, 2020 why am i here?"
although to this point it is really confusing and i do not thoroughly understand it i am hanging in here .
i am very passionate about sports and being in that atmosphere will keep me motivated and able to understand the physical and mental struggles that athletes go through.
last semester i took a sci course (sci phys 220) and being in the sci class really did help me with my grade in the actual lecture.
"there is so much stuff in the world to learn about and therefore, you can never stop learning."
i honestly see no point in this assignment.
i was lucky enough that this class fit in my busy schedule so i could get the extra help.
the reason why i am taking this course is that it satisfies one of my prerequisites for medical school.
"i am here at college because, in this day and age, it is expected of us to go but i can't really imagine doing anything else anyways."
"to continue to pursue this career means that i have to keep up with my classes and know what to take and be here, present and ready to learn."
"the last lab was pretty interesting and i enjoyed it because i got to communicate with my partners to try to figure out the work in front of us and that is what i hope will continue to happen in this class, this is why i am here."
we also have more time to answer them and get into more detail wich is very helpful for me.
i am in this physics class for two main reason.
i am able to learn differently because i am challenged with unfamiliar topics that i'm not accustomed to.
"i hope to get more out of this class, not for my career but for myself to know more of, for fun."
"previously, i was rushed through an 8week physics program and received a decent grade in the end."
"so if i had to answer the question, i would say im here largely in part because of that librarian."
the reason i am here is because i am an engineering major.
why am i here taking a physics class?
this will be the time for me to learn many life lessons either the hard way or the easy way.
"humans grow, adapt, learn from their mistakes, and love."
it's just the most difficult subject for me and i'm not sure how to go about it.
"it is not the only reason however, i find the class interesting and always preferred learning through experinentation and doing rather than take notes."
"but even if that happens, the only option that we have from then on is to find ways to move forward against the roadblocks that are placed before us.but besides all of that, and being philosophical or deep things, we are here to learn!"
i also like to think about the working principle of the mechanics.
i simply am.
i honestly do not want to be here and instead would like to be in bed sleeping.
wasnt aware of it until this semester but its now shaping what my time here at state is going to look like along with what my future might consist of proceeding school.
"my record has accumulated countless w's and a few class failures, mostly reconciled."
so taking physics this class is a mandatory class i need to take in order to reach my degree of being a mechanical engineer.
"i do not like physics, but i must be here.if we are talking about in life, i am not sure."
"out of the bay area universities i could have chosen, they had to be close enough to my house which is in oakland and they had to be universities that i actually wanted to go to."
"ive always tried to take the class but being a popular ge class, it was hard."
computers have always fascinated me and especially growing up in silicon valley it feels like that's where most of the jobs are heading.
my more immediate goal is to pass with this class hopefully with an a so i can take the next step in my academic journey.
david olinger 09022020physics 112why i am in physicsthe reason for me taking a physics class is simple and pretty straightforward.
in order for me to succeed in ocam lecture i believe this sci course will help in doing so.
"at first i transferred here as an economics major, but in the first semester i decided to switch majors."
this is the place where people go to learn more about the things they are interested in and they will guide them to their purpose in life.
im also a big fan of quantum physics as i love learning it all on my own.
most people end up bailing so im hoping sci 111 will provide the assistance i need.
i love school and the work it encompasses but dont like feeling like i am wasting time that i could be using doing something more productive.
while this is my last strictly physics class much of what i will learn will be needed in the next class
i feel like the world is rapidly growing and changing and technology is the main reason why it is.
everyone interpret this question in their own way.
ive always wanted to learn about physics but none of my teachers in highschool made it interesting thats why i never took it in highschool.
i really want to be able to look back at my life and say that i did the best i could.
i want to make things that my family living over there can benefit from.
my name is chelsea.
it was as if my mother had changed forever.
"furthermore, i believe that this course would help me out with the other physic class too."
"i understand that everything that can be done has a reason, like gravity for example and why things fall."
stem has always interested me and what it means to be in that field.
the previous physics class i took was 5 years ago in high school during my sophomore year.
here i can review topics so the information is more likely to stick with me in the long run witch is the goal.
"also, i had no interest in learning the material because i never thought i would come across it again."
there is a recent program that state offers where both can be obtained in a streamlined fashion called the itep program.
"if i could have it my way, i would study physics, chemistry, biology, psychology, and math for the rest of my life, because i love understanding how the world, the universe, and the human body work."
hopefully through my time here at sfsu i can meet new people and have an overall good experience.
chem is a difficult subject for me because there are numerous things that you have to remember.
physics is a fascinating subject that really encompasses everything in the world.
"that is where i am geographically, however, why am in this class?"
"lastly, i have a lot of anxiety around exams, and seeing what really got to me during the mock exam really helped focus me a bit more for the actual test."
"because of covid19, i will be here at my house for the remainder of this semester and maybe the next one."
i am a catholic and i believe it is one of my duties to bring joy and happiness and spread the faith to those around me.
i also find these reflective journaling useless.
"i am over 400 miles away from what i used to call home, away from all my family."
this type of study reinforces learning in the long term by retrieval practice.
i am stressing and failing a course i do not need for my future plans.
i dont believe this will impact or really have too much to do with my major besides the actual science of this class which in which many galaxies are found as precisely as possible by theory and experiments and models and knowledge we get from earth outer space which is relative to the way people think and or come to solution.
"i have always been fond of math and physics since high school, and i continue to look forward to learning more in this class as well as my lecture."
it feels kind of crazy that were all just trapped at home and theres nothing really that we can do to change our reality other than doing simply nothing.
this is the first physics class i have ever taken so i am interested in how it is like.
it helps me dedicate a time to actually study and practice because if i wasnt in this class i would most likely study in the last minute.
"i also realized that taking physics and calculus at the same time was a terrible idea since they teach about the same topics, but the way you work the problems and the answers are completely different."
this is my first sci class and it has so far really helped me learn the topics i have seen in class.
it helps in understanding the mechanics of the body which is an important part of the career i'm trying to go for which is physical therapy.
"i feel like the professors sometimes forget we have other lasses and work, and i hate being on the screen all day."
"because i am an electrical engineering major, i believe that linear systems analysis, and generally signal and systems, to be a foundational class that other classes will build upon."
one of the reasons why i feel like im here in this world is to spread love and positivity .
"so i am here because i want to be, and also because being here does not make me anxious, it makes me happy that i have mentorsfriends i look forward to seeing everyday here at sfsu! christian avilaescobar (id 915841126)"
"at first, i never understood what my major had to do with physics and why i even have to take it."
then i wondered why i like cars so much and realized that three of my uncles and my grandpa were engineers.
"i move to san francisco because i got accepted at the university, and then i realize that am more a person of south california."
"having been working my entire college career, i never really got an option about which teacher to takemore times than not, it came down to when i was free, and when my schedule could be shifted to make it work."
in order to do this i felt that i needed a bit more repetition in the material that is taught to me in class so i can better master the information
i am located in san francisco because the bay area has great biotech companies that i would like to network with and hopefully work for under their cancer department.
i am also here because i have a great support system that has helped my get to this point in my educational career.
here i am.
i hope i am able to earn a higher grade in the math 227 course with the help of this supplemental instruction course.
learning about gravity and doing all kinds of experiments.
i am here at san francisco state to further my education and learn more in order to continue on my path to a good career that i will hopefully enjoy.
i hope that this class will give me a greater understanding of how things work.
i would love to be among those who challenge people to think truly on their own.
i always felt like stem is also a fun way to learn and can be fascinating how the things around us work.
"in order to get a fundamental knowledge on physics, i must do well in these classes which will help my understanding of the science world in a better way."
helping woman and being able to help and see the a human be created and form is so amazing to me and i find it super interesting and i am hoping that being able to go to college and doing good in all my classes will help me with my dreams come true.
"people can say that each person has a different purpose in life, but we all have the one similarity of impacting others."
i wasn't too fond of physics 1; it was hard for me to understand at times and i spend hours trying to grasp the material and still didn't get some of it.
you might not even be the best version of yourself. but still we or i continue to act like these smaller things seem to matter.
"i am not too fond of physics, though it is quite an interesting subject to learn about."
i am here because i am a biology major and this is one of the prerequisites for my major.
i am hoping to learn some new concepts and apply them in this physics lab course.
"my professor would go extremely fast, and would assume we know the concepts we previously learned in high school."
patrick bialy reflection 1 why am i here?
disappointed that we can't have any handson experiment with the topics.
that is what screwed my grade up last minute.
"however, it was really difficult for me because the concepts can get very complicated and there was obviously a lot of math and physics involved which are not my strengths."
i am very glad that i stuck with it and am almost done.
i'm here to fulfill a requirement and prerequisite for some of my major classes.
after i kept taking science classes and it never stressed me out.
i think it was exactly the same prompt as well.
trying to be successful during this class so that i could take physics 2 and finish my requirements.
im at sfsu because i want a degree.
"with that in mind, i am taking this course so that i not only pass my physics class but so that i can better understand the material and how to apply it to everyday situations."
a stepping stone into the major of biology is a better understanding of the world and its laws first before diving further into the life that inhabits the earth.
i am hoping to at least pass this class and hopefully do good in it.
having people that i know i can rely on for anything at any time provides me with a sense of security that i feel is impossible to find in other things.
"meaning i love being with people, animals, math, discussing ethical issues,i love being political, i believe i am good with math."
we exist because we have the potential to create great change.
it helps to surround yourself with people who are also inspired to learn because of the encouragement fed into each other through boost of friendly interactions and assurance.
"but the reality hits and i am living in a pandemic, racial inequality is dividing my country and there are so many basic human rights being violated and is it really worth being here."
"my instructor and i both treated this as a straight math course, and in doing so i failed myself."
"along with that, i just love taking care of my body and doing what is best for it, so taking classes like these, help me to better understand the world and human bodies and how everything works and affects us."
my mother was always stressed out because of her patients and my father had to stay long night at field supervising.
since with how society is constantly changing and that technology is all over the world i figure that this major is one that can help with me finding a goodpaying job.
"its sufficient to say that there is no direct reason for me being here, because i will never know the truth to this question."
"this will be an important class for me as well, and i will have a better understand of how physic works between the human body and other factors"
even if i have to do this class i had many options and i have to make the best of it.
i also enjoy physics.
i am here because the degree i am pursuing will improve the quality of my life.
so another reason i'm in the lab is to form groups that will help me learn the terms and formulas better.
i also never made a study group within my classes.
i am here because i need to get better at math and get a better understanding so a) i don't fail the class and b) so i can have for fun with it when i encounter this type of the future instead of blatant frustration.
"my professor told me he used to be a cls and what he did, and i knew that i could see myself doing it long term in the future."
"so far, i feel like i have better understanding with the moon phases, and ive also learned the difference between the big and little dipper (finally)."
"so naturley with science and math being vital in enginnering, and with mechanical engineering, being not only fairly broad, making it ""easier"" to find a decent paying job in the future, but focusing on the mechanical and physics aspects in technology and computers."
there i completed the first week surveys which are the same ones in your class.andrew placed me in your class around 12am last night and thankfully i woke up early enough to read the email and come to class.
i am here taking this sci 215 class because i am trying to be able to understand the concepts that we are learning during lecture.
i am here because time is the most scarce resource and the most precious thing to give.
"the few people who make it through on experience alone typically get paid less, and even more so if theyre female."
"i grew up obsessed with comic book movies, and seeing real world applications of the technology in these films is also very rewarding and interesting to know that the concepts and studying in my classes can be combined and reworked into something that can truly benefit society."
"i like working in group best i like to compare my answers to others, but also help other understand the concepts as well."
in order to create a design i will need to understand the correct combination of materials in a formation which will give me enough strength to support the top load.
as i finish out this letter the war is becoming more gruesome and harsh.
"but, if i just spend a lot of time on it and study the material while i am doing it, then it usually works out a lot better."
i'm really looking forward to this sci class mainly to have a better understanding of physics ultimately.
"i have heard lots of scary things about organic chemistry, so i wanted to take this course in order to do well in the class, especially because i am moving on the organic chemistry 2."
"i don't see myself taking any more physics classes in the future, but i plan to do my best in this one."
"if i had not been enrolled in this class, i wouldve also been dropped by my phys 220 class."
also because i love the cold weather ;d
i want to become an anesthesiologist in the near future.
my major is microbiology.
"thus, physics is merely an alternate version of math to us."
this class is also an opportunity to meet and engage in conversation with my fellow scientist who also have to probably take this class because of their chosen major but also being able to get that insight from their own perspective on the material.
daniel knapp why am i here?
"i may also try and get a math minor, i heard its pretty easy when you take the cs coursework."
i am here because i am waiting on responses from nursing schools.
the reason i am here is because of my brother marky.
i always hear about people taking a physics class in high school; i wish i could have been that fortunate!
in mathematics we are just basically given the equation already and just plug in numbers.
i look forward to this semester!
why am i here?i am here at san francisco state university in order to further my education.
my reasoning for taking this class has since been changed.
"this was also the one unit i needed in order to consider myself as a fulltime student, so it worked out perfectly."
i aslo really enjoy biology and it is really fascinating to me.
"i am here because i have an opportunity to be here and because of others wise to be in my place, but they cant be."
this laboratory is my 4th college level physics course and i still struggle to understand it's fundamental concepts because it requires too much of my time to comprehend which is limited by the immense amounts of coding that i will have to do in my career.
"as a student, i hit rock bottom between 2018 and 2019, but in that time, reassurance from others in the same situations as i was helped me to begin a new resolve and i am slowly beginning to believe that i am capable of learning difficult topics."
josceline perez 82420 astr 11602 reflective journaling essay 1: why am i here?
to learn everything that i can.
hopefully through diligence and utilizing these additional forms of help i have at my disposal ill be successful in this current physics predicament ive found myself in.
though general physics is not required for my major (kinesiology) many of my classmates who have already taken biomechanics have stated that doing this class has made that class that much easier.
i really want to learn how physics is applied to this world because i know our daily lives has to do something with science.
i am here for a purpose.
since entering my fourth year of college i have greatly expanded my math boundaries but i am still nervous.
being able to work on worksheets and make mistakes on it and learn from it is a great environment.
"i am at home because theres a fire, pandemic, race war, and smoke in the air."
i hope that this is easier for me to understand after i take this lab and the lecture that goes with it.
"i decided to take this class primarily to get a better grade in physics 111; i have never attempted a physics class, so conceptually this is all very new to me."
and physics also promotes the development of human society.
also learning physics is important to me because it is a course that has a lot to do with my planned career.
i am a kinesiology major with an emphasis in exercise and movement sciences.
"reflective journaling 1 i am currently a junior in college, this is my third year attending sfsu. i am looking forward to learning new concepts regarding physics."
i thought it will be interesting to learn about sky and universe.
"for the longest time, i have struggled with this question and i feel as though i still am."
"personally, i think that the labs in physics are very fun and educational."
i am here because i know the class will help me study and dedicate some time to the bio 230 class.
for that to be accomplished i have to be present and do my part in taking these classes that include physics along with others such as biology and chemistry.
i am also taking this course so i can be able to go to pa school and this class is a requirement for my major which will get me into pa school.
i know others might not really care about that but i think that's such an underrated characteristic to have.
i am here because i am expected to be here.
i am a math major but i do struggle with trig stuff and other concepts which means that i have to work harder to keep up with my calc class.
i want to be at the front lines of space exploration (it is my passion).
i am taking an si course because i am setting aside judgement that getting help and asking for help is okay.
"i liked to think i was here just make people laugh, or help them in a math class when they need help because i've been told i was 'smart' (subjective)."
"i also enjoy understanding physics more in depth, because beyond my career it has helped me solve very mundane issues."
"as for my math skills i took calculus 1 a year ago and barely passed it with a c and algebra 1 2 two years ago which i had no problem with, although i'm going to be a little rusty with my mathematical skills, but i think i will be fine hopefully."
"when i was younger, my mother was diagnosed with a brain tumor and it took months of convincing her to finally get surgery to remove the tumor."
ill have to adapt in some way.
"i am in this sci 111 class, because i have never taken physics in high school and i know that physics requires a lot of math in which i am very weak in."
"first of all, i thought the due date meant wednesday by midnight, as in the end of tuesday, so hopefully you do not mark me down for this being ""late."" anyways, why i am here..."
"after graduating high school there are three paths a person might take: work immediately, enroll into the military, or go back to school."
im trying my best to be as successful as i can be.
"the lecture for astronomy was pretty interesting, so i kindof enjoyed it."
graduating can help lead me down the path which reaches my goal.
"even though i never had the chance to take many chemistry classes before, im here to dip my toes in other stem fields."
i dont particularly enjoy the assignments given due to how tedious they can be.
i plan on going to uc davis vet school after graduating from sf state.
i never fully understood the way the universe worked and how big it actually is.
to see how energy principles and ideas are applicable in a more tangible sense.
"everything we do would be considered physics, something falling, how fast we drive and how far can be calculated in physics and measuring."
gladis perez at moment i am still trying to figure out what my purpose is in my life.
i then signed up for physics lab on mondays because i wanted to take the lecture and lab at the same time.
everything obeys the laws of physics.
i am here because i have a goal.
"as a biology major, thus far i have found the subject incredible and has allowed me to open my mind to many things and i am really excited to start practicing what i am learning."
this class will help alot in the future towards my understanding.
"i can't say why i believe this is where i am supposed to be, all i know is that i am not anxious when i am at school, and it is because i feel like i am progressing."
"i am someone who believes in reincarnation as well so sometimes i ask myself, is this the only life i have ever lived?."
"jessica yepez rangel phys 011208 9320reflective journaling 1:""why am i here?""i am here taking general physics laboratory because i have always been interested in learning how the universe works."
im here because i have to be.
im most excited for the experiments because i like being handson so its a little sad that most of our labs are going to be done online with stimulations.
im in this class because i know i struggle with math a little bit and it doesnt help that we only have an hour class when im used to learning things in a longer period of time.
"for bio majors, we need to take physics 111 and then if we want to, we can build off of it and proceed to the next level of physics."
"i could go much more in to the actions i did to get in here, but that's not really interesting."
"otherwise, i'm not a physics person at all and i hope this semester goes well since the classes are remote and we students no longer have the traditional classes anymore."
critical thinking is very important to develop different skills for future jobs.
"i never was the most scienceknowledged person in my classes, nor do i see myself getting a physics career, however astronomy always makes me feel like there is hope, happiness and interest in my life."
i am required to take this class for my major but also to reach my goals such as attending med school.
"often times in the super 'stem' classes like bio or chem, the kids are so competitive and it becomes this glorified competition, not about that."
my professor mentioned something about a sci class when it first started but i did not even think about taking the class.
another reason i am taking this class is that it would make my life much easier if i strengthen my math skills.
if there is something that i love more than anything besides my friends and family it is animals.
"second, i also need this class as a prerequisite for my engr 205: electric circuits which im planning to take in spring semester."
im taking the physics lab because im also enrolled in the physics lecture on mwf. i'm also taking it because in high school i took preap physics and i really enjoyed it but it was kind of difficult for me as well.
i get extra practice and help to understand the problems i have difficulty with and just the material in general.
"that is, my dad was an electrical engineer and my mom was a nurse."
i think i am also here because if i did not have a regular class to sit me down and do my work i would be less motivated and less likely to do it.
in order to achieve my true goals in life i have to be right here.
i decided to study abroad when i was 14 years old.
i wanna enjoy doing those numerical problems again.
for example hybridization levels.
i am in this lab class to finish my lower division courses for my cell biology major.
"my parents created me, i had no say in the matter, nonetheless i'm glad i happened."
another reason i decided to join stem was that i don't know what i like or what i wanna do in college.
"why am i here, in an astronomy lab at 12:22 on this breezy wednesday afternoon?"
so this semester i needed something to change so i've decided to go back to what worked for me in the past.
to be able to do so i need to first accomplish my goal of obtaining a bachelors in kinesiology which requires me to take physics.
i hope to really acquire the skill of critical thinking that goes beyond what the naked eye can see.
"with that, i trust his judgments and solely took this class based on his advise."
"lately i've been feeling very discouraged, especially since the whole covid 19 and everything going on."
it's almost like we are being forced to follow these curriculums in order to learn about sciences.
"everyone have beliefs of their own of what they believe in like opinions, theories or yourself and if you believe in yourself that means you are trying to achieve more in life and have a purpose for yourself, i mean everyone believes in that we were born or put on earth for a reason like a purpose, i personally agree but were all not to sure why were here, but there's one thing i can say and that is to find your own purpose or dream that you want to do and achieve."
"my name is ianna, i was added into lab last night so this is the first session i have attended."
i am also taking this class because it is a requirement.
im here for that.
it is interesting to me to learn about the mechanics of how objects move or why objects remain at rest.
"i must take physics for kinesiology, as it is mentioned on the roadmap, and i might need to take another semester of physics to fulfill a years worth of physics as it is needed for most physical therapy schools."
"this class is also along side a lecture, which has been able to help me better understand concepts by doing experiments."
but the way how i try to view it myself is that when you put an animal down it's for the better.
"im a biology major and its a requirement, but i can at least admit i enjoy doing physics labs."
"in order to get to medical school, i have to take the mcat. on the mcat, there is a whole section dedicated to physics, in order to complete this section, i need to have a deep understanding of physics."
i didn't know if science labs are ok to do in online.
"although i would not choose to take this class on my own, i would not say that i hate the class completely."
"i am currently a biol physio major, which means i have to take chemistry whether i like it or not."
i am here because my future goal is to heal people.
i recall writing the same stuff for both essays.
"sometimes, i have a quarterlife crisis and im not even 25 years old yet."
"i've always thought that physics was all about math but its not, its more of a little bit of math and a little of science."
"and i don't have a vision for what i will want to be, thus, i am here for that purpose."
i chose taking physics lab is because my major is industrial design.
"after thinking for awhile, she told me to read the books on planets because they were, kind of similar. listening to her instructions, i began to read about jupiter,mars, and saturn."
"by taking this course, it will give me a better understanding over concepts and formulas that i may have or havent gone over in my lecture for chem 215 class."
my interests and life experiences have ended me up here.
the last time i took a physics course was in highschool and i was quite often confused while not covering some details through experiments like i wanted to.
"who knows.i have no idea what else to write, but i'm hoping csrelated jobs outside of major cities are abundant, because i'm trying to head out of cali."
it affects everything in the world around us and is important to everyday life and how all objects move!
"i started this new journey 1 year ago, and the pandemic as accentuated my satisfaction with the decision i made."
"ive been in the vet field for about 3.5 years now as a tech and i feel that if i want to continue, its time to transition to vet school."
it's a breadth vs.
my favorite toy growing up was a doctor's kit of toys for children but as i have grown older i realized that my calling was not to work with people in the medical field.
my bootcamp peers who were getting the job offers already had years of experience hobby programming (with projects to show for it) or had a college degree in something.
it is a bit difficult question to answer.
ive been having a quarterlife crisis since i was in high school.
people just live life and go through certain situations but every single event is due to another person's action along with your own.
i am very grateful and blessed to even be able to take such a course.
in order for me to do well in this class i need to first show up and listen attentively and complete all asignments on time.
it is also very difficult for me to understand since it does not spark my interests.
"when i first got started in science i was in elementary, my dad and i entered in the school science contest for fun and we ended up winning."
when drawing up floorplans and starting construction it is important to understand the physics aspects of the building properties.
"once i realized this, i felt like i had no idea what i wanted to do, i still feel like i dont but i have a bit of an idea."
"but, i actually kind of like physics 2!"
im very excited and eager to learn physics.
"you see physics in everyday life such as gravity, acceleration, etc."
in science i really enjoy learning about that body and health of science because i feel in life your wellbeing is the most important thing to worry about.
whenever i am free i dedicate my time to others and that is why i am here.
"in addition, i believe physics will help me increase my critical thinking and problem solving skills."
i am in college because i want to gain more education and provide for my family in the future.
"even though this course might be a requirement for me, i still think that the materials that we will be learning throughout this semester will be essential to my learning and understanding of our current world."
"first of all, it is mandatory and i do not want to fail."
"but overall, i am here because i need extra help with cell bio."
the one goal i have for myself in life is to just be happy.
im kind of confused.
that's a great question.
for the past 2 years i have been trying to get accepted in california maritime academy.
personally the idea of study groups isnt that appealing to me.
"i can calculate it with money, gallons, and miles."
for the sake of answering questions that might appear as a result of such an answer that i have provided; i will indulge thee with hypotheticals.
i think the reason why i am here taking this class is mainly that this is required for my graduate program.
though i would much rather have a vacation type of summer that is currently not possible.
i am here at san francisco state university because i have been working my entire educational life to attend college.
"as for why i am here, i have felt that i have always been here for other people."
i am here solely to learn.
i am here in san francisco because it is one of my favorite places ever.
i am physiology to prepare for my inevitable application to california physician assistant programs.
i also needed to take a physics class for my major and i am taking the sci class to boost my grade.
"i would like to major in computer science, but i enjoy the handson approach to projects and tech."
trying to sleep earlier.
by being in this class i am also able to apply what i learn in lecture to real life models and cases.
i am here in this class at least to gain more knowledge on a science subject that i am very limited in.
"whenever i had a science exam, i enjoyed studying the material."
"although i had taken physics during high school, i never really excelled in it because i found it too difficult to understand fully."
"since, the class is a lot smaller than the seminar it is easier to ask questions."
so i would expect to learn more in depth of how motionthermodynamics works so it can help me in my daily life and the future.
without the add code i would have been forced to drop both this lab and lecture because these to classes have to be coenrolled from what i have read.
i am the one who always remains calm.
"i like learning and attempting new things, which is what physics is to me at least."
"i also have chances to observe realistically from the class about the earth, univers, stars , galaxy, and so on."
this was a golden gem to me when i grew up being a fun game to play whenever to get lost into this 2d world and enjoy it at its fullest.
"i am looking forward to staying here for the next couple years and building a new life, making california and sf state my home too."
i am looking forward to what other things and ways i can go about for solving a physics problem.
"it has been a few years since i studied science, so i think it is important that i get all of the help, and resources that are provided to me through the school."
"therefore, i am here for my education."
to better one self and be able to succeed later on in life.
"this is my last semester here, and i found out that i needed this course to graduate."
"in high school, many of my friends were taking physics and ap physics and i would hear about the topics while they were studying."
physics why am i here?
"in addition to why i am here, its because this lab interest me the most compared to any other lab, i have no experience nor did anyone told me the difficulty."
"if i am to be in the medical field, i would of course, have to take science classes and prevail."
with this help i will be able to create a good base understanding of the material and build upon it with new future topics in following semesters.
"i used to think that there wasnt a real place for me in school and barely skated by in it, and now im making up for where i was before."
i believe this question could be answered in many different way.
all i had to do was to put in the effort and stay on course with my goal and i was destined to be the person that i was meant to be.
i am here because of a variety of reasons.
i definitely do not know what im doing but im not the only one.
"i am here, taking phys 112 because it is a required class for my major, biology."
i also want to be more prepared for the labs for the semester and know whats going on and what i'm doing during the labs and be more prepared for it.
"of california, san francisco, and get a good job upon graduating."
i chose to come to sfsu in order to still be close to home and limit debt as much as possible so early on in my life of learning.
"physics was very difficult to understand when i was thrown with equations that didn't work when trying to solve problems, and the only way teachers taught it is by abiding by the equations and not explaining the conceptual portion as well as they should be."
"if that was not the case i probably would not be sitting here in this class as i write about the topic simply asking, why am i here?"
the 2 things that are my main motivators.
i thought it couldn't hurt anything and it would just be an extra study session that i would get college credit for.
"i think i do better around people, but im still very confused about what i should do with my life."
but both these are really good tutoring sessions because the students teaching know the tricks in order to survive the main course.
"in terms of being in san francisco state, i am here because i was accepted here and it is located in san francisco which called to me when i was in high school."
in the first two weeks i thought online calculus two would be easy to learn on my own.
i like the lab portions.
"though, i think its okay not to know the origins of life or why were here."
"i think physics is an interesting subject based on the science programs i have watched like nova, and i think it would be helpful to take a class to better understand the programs."
"firstly, i have a pretty big gap between my biology and ochem lectures so taking this course would minimize it."
i attend san francisco state university to help my future self in my leading to my career.
"being able to cherish others and value others is something that gives me a reason to care about life, and i dont feel that i should just live a life for myself since i feel it wouldnt be much of a meaningful life if im only fulfilling things that make me satisfied."
but i like to do some experiments that are funny and interesting since i like to learn how things move.
thinking about how we are only floating in space with who knows who else out there has always been in the back of my mind.
"i don't know what to expect for physics since the last physics course i took was in high school, which was more of a tutorial period then and actual class."
i also love solving problems.
i hope to understand physics and maybe one day be able to say that i understand at least the basics.
the reason for why i am here is because i need to go get my degree.
i was on academic probation last semester and didn't know about the hold that was keeping me from adding classes to this semester so i had a late start with the classes i wanted.
"that second math class was not offered at my community college though, so i was going to take it at this institution no matter what."
"in addition, i wouldn't probably feel so tired by the end of the 3 hours and still want to remain focused."
i want to give inspiring life stories to my future generational family members.
"i had taken the phys 222 last semester but didn't pass, because of absent."
"also, in my opinion, physics, biology and chemistry are all intertwined with each other."
"however, this lab class provides me more opportunity to understand and explores the daily life of physics."
i guess i cannot answer this question because i have been very doubtful lately and do not know where i am headed in the future.
i got to sfsu for my passion for filmmaking.
my favorite part is learning about extraterrestrial being.
"so, i scammed my friend to come with me to the first class because i did not want to go alone."
"i was never big on english class in hs and coming here and realizing that my major was just going to be a one essay after another, i couldn't do it."
"during my countless hours volunteering at hospitals to the countless hours being admitted, i feel like i would be comfortable to pursue a career."
"since i need to pass the lecture and lab, i am here to learn and apply these concepts to my major."
although i did not ask for this process at this time...it came to me at the perfect timing.
i want more than anything to be a surgeon.
i also understand that this is a relatively important class as physics is found all around us and not just in math formulas we learn in class.
having labs with the lecture courses generally help me apply some concepts in the real world and lets me get to know some of my classmates even more.
the reason i am here has several layers.
this means that i am going to need to understand some of the material that i learn in physics for my specific major.
"before taking this class, i have not taken a physics class since my freshman year of high school, which was about 6 12 years ago."
college education brings forth lots of opportunities (or so ive heard) that have the ability to change your life.
anyway i think astrophysics majors are so cool and so intelligent.
i originally got into san francisco state as a physics major but decided to change it because i plan on transferring to another school in the netherlands and they only offer an astronomy major for english speakers.
i love coming to class with people having the same drive and motivation as i do to learn the required material and helping others out if they run into trouble.
i think it's really amazing when i see someone or become acquainted with someone that can have a conversation with anyone about anything.
this class has a lot of value in many ways and i am glad to be taking it.
"this has been something i always needed to work on, and i feel like this class with not only help me get organized and understand topics and find out why the way to solving these are different, it will also help me to understand where it starts and it would be a nice midweek review of concepts we have learned."
"well, thats because i am a science major, specifically a bio physiology major and i must complete the introduction to physics course series in order to complete my major requirements in order to receive my degree."
i love biology.
i also believe that there are other types of life out there in the universe and that there are alternate universes where you made a different decision from what you made.
the concept of physics is new to me but i am interested in learning more about it.
sfsu was the only state university that provided me with the most financial aid and the closest home.
i also liked the bay area and thought i could find more of my interests here.
going to college was an easy choice for me because ive seen what could happen if you dont work hard and chase your dreams.
it wasnt until my first semester as a junior that i realized that i saw no future for myself in business.
i always wanted to die doing something heroic and making my last words something a long the lines of i got this.
i believe that humans have intrinsic value and that all are made in the image of god.
alexander chen 2192020 sci 227 why am i here?
"when i was in high school, i was a good student of physics and was praised by many teachers."
then after that i think i'll just participate in the rat races for the next couple of decades and hopefully i'll make the best out of it.
i find it easier to study with a whole group of people because concepts can be learned faster with different study habits and tactics that others have.
this class is also extremely helpful because it helps me review what i learned in lecture and use what i learned in class to solve for how to do the labs within this class.
"however, the decision to go to college was completely up to us."
getting a degree to me means one more tool i need to move into a career where i can have a good impact and make myself happy doing something i enjoy.
"nonetheless, im excited to be in a lab with quite a bit of fun classmates and to be able to rely on both their help along with our professor."
"my dad was in the military so, we moved around a little bit."
through learning about the body and how to get stronger ive also found reasons to be more connected to this world and other people.
chemistry so far is going pretty well i think.
"this is helpful since it will reinforce my confidence in physics concepts, and that confidence will help me feel more at ease in research environments (specifically research labs for phd programs)."
i am here in physics class because i feel like physics is fun.
i dont regret anything.
physics is an interesting subject that has plenty of real world applications that are interesting and will help to learn general knowledge that will help later on in my academic journey.
"after reading the question prompt, two responses came to mind job opportunity, and role model."
the stem field is a bit more detail oriented and difficult compared to many other fields that are offered.
"overall, sci slows me to fully comprehend what im learning in class and lets us meet more people in the stem field."
estefan dinarte 9102020 phys 102 why am i here i am here because i would like to fu rther my knowledge and education.
"since newton's epochmaking treatise on the mathematical principles of natural philosophy, physics has been an independent discipline."
i am a person that gets most of his learning from a visual stand point.
"the reason why i've chosen to be in stem field is because i'm facinated by math and physics, although am not excellent."
i always wanted to study abroad.
i like being in this study group because i get to meet new people and talk outside of the lecture.
this is why i am here right now.
"im not quite sure what the question is referring to but if it is in regards at where i currently live the answer would be that i am here in san francisco, ca because i decided to attend college here."
"if i'm being honest, if this class wasn't mandatory for my major, i wouldn't be here right now simply because it wouldn't benefit me as much as taking another cs class would."
i understand that they want to make sure that i have a certain level of academic competence by getting an excellent grade in second semester physics.
"gravity, air resistance?"
i am here so i am knowledgeable enough to transform and create ideas and creations.
this meant i have to pass calculus 2.
but i can't apply it to solve the problems.
"my class is a little slower paced, so the si class gives me at the very least an introduction to a topic that we havent gone into depth on in my lecture."
i didnt know what to expect and i was actually really nervous to how well i was going to do.
"also, its partially my fault."
"physics is honestly a really hard class for me, i hate math and this is math on a second level it involves you to be more aware and it is a really fast paced class."
"also i got into the mindset that i am choosing to be there and that is why i am here, in middle school we felt forced to go to school."
"after my first class session in the si class, i came out with so much clarity and understanding, that there is no way i could bare skipping this class."
"i think overall, those are the reasons that i am here."
"a year ago, i chose to take astronomy because the other science class named intimidated me, ive never been good at science so the idea of taking biology or chemistry sounded scary."
i have not taken chem in a good minute so some of the stuff might go over my head but i am willing to do everything i can to get the highest grade possible.
"ive heard good things about these supplementary courses, so im hoping that i can get an a in bio with the help this class will provide me."
"honestly, i struggle a lot with calculus 3 concepts, so sometimes i feel really behind because i always have to refresh on the basics."
"i guess that's similar to our discussion section of our lab writeups, but i digress."
i am glad i joined this sci course and excited to see how this year goes.
i would have much preferred to be in one for physics or data structure but my schedule overlapped with their times.
"despite being a biology major, i genuinely believe that understanding basic physics concepts will be applicable in my future research work."
"it was also a really hard time for me to get through, because i was really struggling with deciding if healthcare was really the right path for me, and i felt like i was back to my old self that was feeling so inferior and not good enough from a few years ago."
"secondly, i am curious about astronomy."
i know learn that i need to start trying at the beginning of the class because physics builds up upon itself.
i am here because i needed assistance in my biology class and i really noticed a difference in the way i understand and study in my biology class.
"when i entered this class i wasnt quite sure what to expect, but ive always had an interest toward astronomy and figured i would enjoy it."
"isn't the purpose of life, just to live it?"
this essay is meant to connect you to your purpose.
i am here because i believe i have a purpose.
"other than that, i don't really know why else i'm here."
"eventually, when i attended high school, i was apart of an internship at the california academy of sciences as an education intern who would teach people about the various scientific topics that are discussed here."
the list just keeps going and i understand that there should never be a perfect solution to everything.
"anyways, i really like this class."
"i know that many times we battle certain obstacles and we question why us, but i am a stronger believer that everything happens for a reason and only the strongest soldiers are put for those battles."
"when i read why am i here, the first thing that came mind was that i am here because this lab is required to be taken while i take physic 230."
as an intro course i hope to learn the basics of learning how to calculate motion in objects and be able to do it confidently.
every person ive met before this point was meant to pass by me and give me some kind of influence so i can harbor the best self i can ever hold.
if we are talking about why am i at sfsu it because of the great kinesiology program that is offered here.
what ai can do is only induction.
"i was looking for something similar with phys 111, so thats why im here."
how is the light bulb work?
"for a first time physics student, i sure feel confident that i will be successful in this course because sci is very helpful and im really interested in the material so far."
this course i am in is a supplementary course that is meant to give extra work in an attempt to help performance in the class.
i feel happy being able to explore and have fun.
i suppose i am also here because lab is a physical reminder and helps learning the core concepts that is being discussed in lecture.
i am here because it's a required class.
i hope to pass chemistry and to really remember the topic with the help of this sci class and those who are part of it.
i came from china i moved to the us when i was 12.
"why am i here, you ask?"
i'm here because i like math and i am interested in physics and learning how things work.
i felt interesting in physics when i first drew a fbd to analyze a force system.
"it's not entirely hard for me, i suppose, although the labs quizzes are somewhat frustrating."
i am in college to earn my degree.
i also find physics to be a very fascinating subject.
"i'm here because i have to take this course with the other physic class, but more importantly, i'm trying to learn as much as i could."
this allows me to learn faster.
"i always tried to make a joke out of it and say 'i'm here as someone's punching bag', 'i am someone's shoulder to cry on', or 'i am here as a placeholder'."
the thought of having ill people looking to me for guidance compelled me to keep focused on the relevant course because i feel medical treatment is satisfying form of affection and care a human can give to another.
"additionally, it will increase my chances of getting a job in the first place."
so thats why im here taking chem 180 which led me to take sci 180 so i can get a good grade and transfer out of sfsu.
"i also notice that not every lab is as interesting as checking instagram, but i do want to get out something which can be used whether in the long term future or the upcoming exams for physics."
"i got into other california state universities as well, but i was more familiar with san francisco state because i've done an art exhibition here once and i knew a bunch of people in my after school program from my middle school that i admire that went to san francisco state and i knew it was a pretty decent school."
"to answer the question as to why i am here, it is for myself."
"ultimately, i decided that i was interested in the content of the class and it wouldn't hurt to get the required course out of the way while familiarizing myself with physics a little more before taking the lecture class."
"also, i have always been interested in the physics because most of the things in this universe follow the laws of physics."
so i think that this class will provide me with the extra help that i need for me to earn an a in chem 115.
my major is electrical engineering so this lab is going to be very helpful for me to get my initial basics down.
"i enjoy science a lot, by learning more i feel like the world becomes both easier to understand because there are so many working parts."
i also heard you get credit for it and its just graded on participation so it was kind of a no brainer to sign up.
"i remember in physics part 1, i really thought i understood it but when the problem slightly deviated from the sample problem, i was stuck again."
i am looking forward to learning many things about how things work and interact.
however i picked astronomy over the other labs because its actually a class that im interested in.
"to start of, i am here in this world because my mom wanted a child, specifically a daughter."
"im not sure why it has that connotation built into my head, but its there."
"i still have about two semesters left, it has been a different experience for me going from community college to sfsu."
another aspect i hope to improve is the communicative aspect that is used in the sciences; to be able to attain the rich vocabulary and certainty that comes after much practice and dedication.
i only have bits of memories from growing up.
this course is part of the path i have to take to achieve my career goals.
one of them is the most basic reason which is to complete my major requirement.
whether that be through reviewing my bio journals or going over topics that were taught in class.
i'm here so i can go higher and higher in my college career.
i am excited to see what i learn and the labs we will work on.
i'm also here because i've decided to stay here when i could have gone back to my homework of san diego and possibly apply for transfer somewhere closer to home.
may be this is because i have to solved the physics problems in a bounded time limit.
"it is also useful as it serves as a handson experience for proving what we learn in class and an introduction to proper research, a career i also plan on pursuing."
i am specifically in this astronomy lab class because my schedule wouldnt allow for a different class that would not be on friday.
i wold have also much rather preferred this class would have been broken up into two days juts as the lecture is.
"i have doubts about my capabilities, however, even with my doubts and questions, i still feel that it is normal to still be going into the world not getting everything right and not knowing all the answers."
i attended college of marin before transferring this spring.
i think that physics is necessary to get a really wellrounded understanding of the sciences.
i do have a bit of interest into how planets behave and general astronomy interests that sort of fall into the category of physics.
i'm feeling happier which is good.
"as time goes by i'm starting to develop more each day whether it's from education, social, or even in a physical aspect."
"clear instructions of what i shouldshouldnt do, but then to be allowed to do so without micromanagement."
i signed up for this sci class to get additional help in chemistry.
and to accomplish my goals i am taking the required courses for my major and any other course that i will need to advance my knowledge in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.
"point and case, my cat sitting on my printer glaring at me because he wants something from me."
i am here as a student to learn from my peers and my instructors.
"we study old architecture and literature to learn of the people before us, what they left behind was for our advancement as a human species."
i mean seeing the struggles we all went through is something i wanted to change for my children in the future i wanted to be better.
they sparked an interest in me to go into this field and i have been pursuing it since then.
"basically, i'm learning some life skills with this class."
i was hoping by taking the physics sci class it could help me to continue to succeed despite some obstaclesi have faced in the past and the obstacles.
"""why am i here?"" i am here because i need this class."
it is a combination of how it was taught to me and my lack of digging deeper to understand the applications and concepts.
im hoping to understand and capture the understanding of everything.
"with the tools that obtain with these classes, i hope to take these skills into a practical setting."
my favorite topic to study in physics was forces (especially gravity) because i loved calculating for forces in the egg drop lab.
my major is microbiology but i love learning about different fields of science and will continue to do so.
i am here because i like to know how the world works.
being able to go to college will give me the knowledge i need to know what i should do when i get my job as a business major.
the labs are better than if i were to be in biology or chemistry because i can at least understand whats going on in this class.
"overall, i did fine in the class, i guess, especially since it was an ap class."
"so far, we are learning about velocity and distance and the forces acting in certain objects."
physics has a great deal to do with energy and after i graduate i would like to work with that as an emphasis.
"plus, it gives me an extra day to i guess study the material and ask questions if i have any."
we are all here for a reason.
because major is computer engineering which means i have to take this class.
"in general, i really find my passion for learning about new things in my classes and especially being challenged in many ways that i usually dont in my other classes."
the only thing is physics has so much concepts and i do not know how to take in so much information in so little time but i guess it is time to start figuring that out.
"or maybe you question your ownmotivations on why you live, wake up, eat, and work for years to the purpose of raising a family orhoarding wealth?"
i decided that i would go back to school to ensure that i didnt fall into the same trap that many mill workers did.
i am here because i need to take the physics as a graduation requirement for my major.
i am also here to participate in and refine the information that i learn from the lecture.
by taking this physics course it will allow me to take that extra step forward to achieve my goal.
"i am in school to gain build a network, get experience, have fun, learn about a subject that i am passionate in, and be able to contribute that back to society when i graduate."
"in one sense, i am here because i completed physic 1 and now i would like to complete physics 2."
i'm here because i needed a new goal and this seemed like a reasonable one.or it is what society makes me feel like is a good goal.
to answer the question why am i here? first of anything i am here in physics because it is required in my major.
there are a few different things that guided me into a stem field.
there are millions of galaxies and in each galaxy there are millions of stars.
moreover i also want to gain new knowledge in science by listening to my peers through discussions and bounce off ideas from one another.
it's funny because ive never been happier than i ever been because of everything ive been doing lately.
i like how this course is making me remember the little stuff i forget but also teaching me about stuff i really forgot about.
i took this class this semester because i need it and it was a good time for me to take it.
"as a physics major, i would like to experience what it is like to be in a lab because my goal in the future is to work doing research."
"yes, this class is required for me to take as apart of my major but i am also excited to see what i will learn."
i am here because i will be needed to save someone's life one day.
although we have this space i feel that we all can do better about getting administration to give us even more resources like other schools in neighboring cities.
"i personally agree that physics is important to consider in each of our lives, this is why i am here taking this course even though it is a requirement for my major i am still interested in applying these new concepts i will learn throughout the semester."
i would also like to see a botany advisor for some guidance and help on if that is a good option for me.
"i don't have to best study methods initially, i tend to procrastinate a lot and cram, so this gives me more time to study."
"ultimately, i am here in regards to pursuing a better future for myself."
i am currently studying biology here at sfsu and am so far enjoying it.
"living on my own has also taught me a lot, for example it has helped me with my time management, budgeting, and other adult things."
"""why am i here?""i think about why i am here a lot, actually."
also i am here because i didnt take the lab when i took the lecture at my community college in southern california.
"i have some regrets about not starting at a state school because i could have completed my school journey faster, but at the same time i have learned some valuable life lessons in my classes"
"i have taken sci classes before, and i took sci 115 last semester which i found was useful for my success in chem 115."
well i have many reasons that explain why i am here but let me just explains the reasons that are the most significant.
i can't really think of where else i would be.
like i still remember as a kid i spent all my money on lego sets and rc cars and i always liked building and modifying to make it better by trial and error.
in way like having a sort of credibility or being able to make money to then later fund my dreams.
doing well in school helps me love myself more and more.
the answer to why i am here depends on peoples mindset and their preference.
"i really enjoyed physics in high school and was even ambitious enough to take ap physics, but i later ended up dropping the class feeling extremely overwhelmed with my other ap classes."
":) i am from la, and was looking forward to moving up north for school."
being here i feel like i should start becoming more involved in my major and clubs but feel im not ready yet because of how little background i have but obviously everyone has to start somewhere.
"being able to get medical examinations has been rough over the last couple of years and some people are not able to afford it, so if i can provide them a service at little to no cost it would be a good experience."
i have never taken any physics course before so i am nervous.
growing up i was always told that if you tried your best in any situation there would be nothing to regret.
especially switching all of the classes to online classes has been very hard to adjust.
"however, in a short term sense i am here in this lab to further learn about physics in a hands on way and get a good grade that should help boost my gpa, and prepare me for future classes including the next higher level physics courses."
the physics classes here feel more like they take time away from learning how to code and focusing on things that stray away from my future career.
"my only experience of physics is from high school, so im ready to learn more on the concepts of physics."
if this is a philosophical question i am not sure why i am here.
that's such a big question and i just woke up.
"however, i personally am very much interested by this topic and am even more enthusiastic in being able to make connections from real world situations and problems that can be traced back to chem 180."
"i am here, because i look forward to what the future holds for me; the experiences i can gain, the new connections i can make, and also the new places i can explore."
i am also pursuing a higher education so i can become smarter because i feel like not going to college is a waste of time since its harder to find a job without a degree.
i'm taking this class to get a good grade in physics and to understand the material.
why am i here i can write a lot about this topic but what i want to write about is why am i here in the united states.
which has helped me in riding a motorcycle knowing what some outcomes might be in certain situation (braking in a corner).overall i enjoy science ever i was in middle school where i built a structure that could survive a san francisco earthquake.
i also love working with children so being a pediatrician is what im looking forward to for my future job.
i have never taken physics before so i feel that i am learning the concepts slower than my other classmates.
it should be streamofconsciousness writing from the heart.
i found that i was really good at calculus and i was struggling to understand physics.
when asked why i am here i automatically think about all the reasons that i am attending college.
"im stuck between two career paths, research psychology and research biology but i don't know how or if i could do both."
physics happens to us all the time and to know how it works would be beneficial in solving a problem when im older or now.
"in physics lab we are learning about charges, coulombic forces and electric fields."
i often wonder what is my purpose for living.
i suppose im taking this sci chemistry course so that i can expand my general chemistry knowledge to see if i can apply chemistry concepts in my future research work.
i am taking this course because it is a part of my requirement for kinesiology.
"this is my last physics lab i need to take, so i am trying to end on a good note."
i think it's important to understand the basics of science and be able to understand how this all affects us and the world around us in a science perspective throughout or lives and even on the daily.
the bay area will forever be my home.
and my goal in this life is to one day go back to my country and open an all women clinic for women to be able to give birth there without their husbands thinking otherwise.
the ability to always learn more than what you did yesterday amazes me.
"there's more of a force rather than a will to continue living this way, mostly it is out of guilt."
there is a saying that college opens doors.
"the physic s class i previousl y took was phys 111, and our tea cher was not great."
i am a prekinesiology major and i have to take phy 111112.
im here to make friends and a study group.
so im pretty determined to ace all of my classes.
but why am i really here?
"after healing my elbow completely, my physical therapist taught me important tips on taking care of my body overall as well as continuing my dreams of playing basketball professionally."
i choose this class because i am interested topic in math or physics.
i am at sf state because it was the only baseball scholarship i received.
i am really happy to be here today and have such an awesome lab instructor.
we see a lot of things happen around us every single day but i think a lot of people don't know exactly how things work exactly.
because to make someone and myself happy.
"so, i chose to go back to school."
"as a result, learning and studying has been much more difficult because of how different it is."
"turns out the answer was zero but not because the snake was sleepy.) plus, we had to make a lot of little 'machines"" like a mousetrap car and, for some reason, i was never any good at that. again, frustratingly so."
"it is also helpful for those who understand a concept to aid in teaching their peer what they know because if someone is able to explain something, they truly understand the concept behind it."
i dont know how this class will be online but i hope it is fun.
the us for this class is important because the earth and its climate is shaped by physics so knowledge on the subject is useful for the future.
"jordan passed away unexpectedly this year, on march 2nd, 2019."
"i have taken a sci course back in chemistry 115, and i would say that it a major help."
"talking to people is my favorite task to do, just getting to know others and being able to give them the opportunity to be heard so that is often how i go about my days."
"as a kid, i've always wanted to be a veterinarian, but i have also shown interest in other fields of medicine throughout the years."
"stars, sun, moon, and earth each have a role to play."
we as humans are all doing the same thing.
"i think sf is very diverse, i can meet all different kinds of people in sf, and people in sf are very open to everything, and i feel that everyone can be accepted in this city."
"being in this physics lab reminds me that school is a grind, and you have to keep going in order to be successful."
"to be fair im taking this supplementary course because i suck at math, more specifically i suck at calculus."
what make the car run?
"but the other way i interpret it is, why am i here on this earth?"
"in physics, we will learn about how pressure and forces work on our body and this will be fundamental to how i will diagnose and understand my patient's conditions or symptoms."
i guess in the grand scheme of things i am just here on this by chance.
since the start of the semester i have been struggling to keep up with the course work because i do not really understand the concepts so when i get one or a couple right then the last one wrong it makes me restart.
"i went from panama to miami, florida then to delta junction, alaska then athens, alabama and finally i moved out to san francisco, california to attend college."
"i have never been good at math before and when i started going to the first couple courses of phys 111, i saw the class as a math class but with more conceptual work as well."
my goal is to peruse pediatric psychiatrist as a private practice.
i have spent a good amount thinking hard about this question and i still can not manage to answer it properly.
however i am here in this physics course and other required classes that i need to take for my studies in order to pursue further education and get a college degree.
physics is an interesting yet so boring topic because of how much things overlap and you have to learn and memorize a lot of things i can just imagine that.
i became truly inspired after watching the movie retelling of stephen hawking's life: the theory of everything.
i also get anxious when i see people leave early because they finished early because then i start to think that i'm going too slow.
"i'm actually tired since i've been going to school since i was 5, so i hope i can take a break soon."
i am also here to expand my understanding of how physics does really connect to the world and the challenges that await me for this course.
making real world connections between what i learn in the class room and all the types of physics around me everyday will be very interesting.
"now that i have explained the maco and micro reasons why i am here, i find myself attempting to finish two hundred words."
i remember my physics class in high school it was really awesome.
to be honest physics is a science i struggle with the most and maybe taking this course will help me get a better understanding of what physics is and how you can see physics in your daily life.
i am so privileged to be able to be going to college and be able to further my education.
"in order to have the degree to assist patients, i need to major in biology and take the required courses, like physics, in order to master the subject."
"in some cases, if i were to not understand some key points from john kims lecture; by being part of sci305, i can potentially get a better understanding of those key points from lectures other than just having to participate in study group sessions."
"it will also prepare me for general physics 2, which will hopefully help me down the road somehow when i am in pharmacy school."
"this semester i am taking physiology and lab, bio 230 and lab, physics and lab, yoga, and political science."
"after just the first class, i just already feel like the instructors gave me a ton of helpful tips to help me to thoroughly understand the concepts."
i am not interested in physics and sometimes it is hard for me to grasp the concepts and formulas in class.
my dream goal is to have an animal sanctuary or rehabilitation center of my own.
that's the kind of legacy i want to be remembered as and a future i want to leave for the children of tomorrow.
"even though this class has no relation to my major which is business finance, i do find this class to be informative and helpful."
you get to learn about a lot of things and a lot of different ideas which may be new to you.
i took astronomy last semester and really enjoyed it.
i am here also because i enjoy learning about science and new theories and concepts.
"even now, there are many people who can't afford to attend school and want to while others who can attend school but throw away their chances by not trying hard."
i still want to try my best to finish as soon as i can.
i have already worked way too hard and put in too much effort to be rejected.i am here also to learn and make observations that i usually never would outside of a controlled environment.
i am here because i didnt know what i wanted to do after highschool i didn't really have a goal or anything.
im here to see nature and admire how beautiful it is.
"i think calculus 2 is a challenge that i will overcome, and having this class will help."
"also, this is a 1 unit course so it's not that high but it's a very easy a in this class as long as i participate, but this class will help my gpa because i will have a in a 1 unit and this class will help my chem lecture grade be higher."
this is one of them.
i am here in this class because bio 230 is the first class in the biology series and it is the foundation to everything we learn from here on out.
it was my decision to study microbiology specifically.
"we do not know and will never know what is after humanity, and this is crazy to think about because we still push ourselves everyday to be the best hardworking person we can be."
it probably wasnt the best idea since last semester i took the lecture and didnt do too hot with that one.
i'm hoping that in this course we'll conduct some experiments that'll at least about something i've never seen before.
i have always been fascinated with doing hands on work and trying out experiments.
"in terms of existing, i am here because i am searching to find my purpose in life to fulfill as well as to enjoy my time being, to experience and to do something that makes me happy."
i go to school because i only see one career path for myself.
"maybe were really here for no reason, which is why early humans decided to build civilizations."
the first time i took it was two semesters ago and i failed the class.
"i know this is not a completely precise answer as to why i am here, but is is a start."
"still, i don't really understand how it fits into my major."
i wanted to go down south to maybe cal poly slo but as it turned out my measles 3.6 gpa was no match for college acceptance standards so i was rejected from most of the schools i had my eyes on.
"i took physics class, because it is something that i enjoy solving and putting brains into, apart from my major subjects which actually involves a lot of memorization."
because what we doing in lab shows us that physics is happening in every minutes of our live and in every situation even when you are doing nothing something related to physics it happening.
not being able to grasp the information in this class has discouraged me and makes me question why i am in school.
i am here because i am a prekinesiology major and it is a prerequisite for my major.
it is cool to know the different phases of the moon and how to easily find the stars in the sky.
my siblings are both engineers and i feel expected to major in stem and make as much as they do.
i am here because i do not want to waste my opportunity and be the best i can be.
"this sci course gives me additional resources that i can use to help ,e study and do well in the course."
i took an astronomy class in high school and thats when i started to realize that this sort of science interested me the most.
"i have been subjected to so many treatments, medications, doctor appointments, and hospitalizations, i have lost count on the exact number."
"most of the time i do not think about why i am here, but the question runs through everyones mind at least once in their life and they contemplate what exactly life is and how we got here."
i intend to put my part in the lab and its reports.
i also need physics 222 because it is the lab class for physics 220.
"commuting to san francisco every day from sanmteo is a little bit costly, so hopefully i'll be able to find a good apartment closeby, and maybe find good internships that relate to my major to help me get a good start in my career after i graduate."
however i was much younger then so it is very possible that i was just not ready for that kind of material because physics is a very challenging subject.
i am originally from san diego (socal) but decided to go to san francisco state not only to be in one of the most beautiful cities in california but because i love the energy and environment san francisco offers.
"another reason why i am attending this school is because i feel like there's more programs and internships to get involved in, i feel like this school has so much to offer."
i wanted to experience a different environment and a different culture because not everything done in socal is done in norcal.
applying the laws of physics to our everyday life like newtons laws.
lowkey school makes me happy.
"someone whose able to smile, and remain positive through everything she's faced."
"since i first began to take it, i have felt a connection to chemistry, and now finally i am on the path to creating a career for myself in a field i really enjoy and do well in."
or i am also interested in sports medicine and orthopedics.
that way we can reduce the amount of pollutants that we make and hopefully our race will live past the year 2100.
"therefore, i would like to learn more about physics and understand how useful it can be to my major prebiology."
our life include something contain physics but i didnt realized before.
i could always thank the pandemic for giving me the chance to take five classes in the summer and getting ahead to the point where i could take this class.
people make claims based on their emotivist (emotional intuition if you will) beliefs that we are here because we have a purpose.
i really want to go into business and create an idea that can benefit society.
i know this isnt very practical but its a skill i desire.
i don't know how and what strategies i should do to be able to succeed in this class but i am for sure to give my best so i can get an a at the end of the semester.ps: thank you for this week's lab.
my favorite thing about moving here was that there were so many passionate people.
youd be amazed at what can be learned.
"in order to achieve this goal, i will need to get accepted into an accredited veterinary school."
i am taking this sci course to get more practice and a better understanding of calculus 2.
"i can remember being in the eighth grade looking up different theories of physics, like einsteins theory of relativity and using it to explain black holes."
it's a subject i have found interesting since high school and am glad i had the opportunity to take it again.
"a lot of my family members did not go to college, and they were counting on me to accomplish what they did not."
this lab class for me is another way of extending my scientific knowledge and helps me experience new scientific theories.
i wanted to challenge myself and i wanted to perform at my absolute best.
"since i am a personal trainer and have been coaching clients in different populations for about 4 years, i feel this is my passion and my calling."
i think sci would definitely enhance my learning abilities but also my academic selfesteem since i wont be the only student struggling with the subject.
"i was not very prudent on taking notes because it was my last class of the day, this makes the labs more challenging for me due to the fact i hardly remember anything."
"i strongly believe that you should surround yourself with people who will make you the best version of yourself (as a student, friend, person, etc.)."
"i do anticipate learning something new in each of my classes, including this one."
"hopefully, this class will do the same, i hate but also love ochem, but its so complicated and lecture instructors goes so fast hopefully they can help supplement what i miss."
and i am very proud of where i have gotten.
"but here we are doing the lab online.due to covid that we never expected, i'm sitting here in my room taking class online because all of the campuses are closed due to the virus."
that depends how you define here.
"reflection 1 quite frankly, i am glad this essay is informal, because i have a lot to say regarding the topic of why i want to go into the stem field."
"this class seems very comprehensive compared to college prep physics that i took in high school, so i feel that i will be heavily engaged in this class."
"i found myself having the most problem with converting from kg,mg,etc to like g, l,ml etc."
i am very sick right now.
now i feel like i will be taking more sci courses in the future as i see how beneficial they are in motivating me to practice what i have been learning in class.
i am here because i want to be able to do better in my math class.
so the class was boring and i did not get the chance to fully enjoy the fundamental understanding of physics until i attended sfsu. i hope that by taking this lab class will help me have a better understanding of motion and the way how things works.
i'm here because i want keep up with my math class and not fall behind for whatever reason.
"when i was a child, i wasnt really good at math but throughout time, i am in love with it, i love the moment when i solve the problem and find out the answer of the problem."
i mean like ?????
i do believe there are more efficient ways to learn compared with our current education system.
"by the end of this semester, hopefully i will understand the scientific explanation behind common actions like throwing a ball or dropping something from a high height."
it is my first semester at san francisco state university so i hope to start off strong and earn all a's this semester.
"i think labs are about looking in depth after having a result or data in order to prove your answer, so by taking this lab i can learn to elaborate more and expand my thoughts."
the reason i am enrolled in this class is because its a prerequirement for my major.
"in addition, san francisco is such a fun city."
"i am currently taking physics lectures, this class will help understand the material a lot better by having oneon one discussions with people in my lab and asking my instructor for a more detailed answer if i am stuck on a problem."
"thinking more of where i am today, i honestly do not know if my existence will provide any drastic change to the world, but i do know my passion for science will eventually lead me somewhere in life."
the class is also based on what we cover in lecture so it gives us extra time to process what we covered and develop our questions.
it took until my junior year to finally make a decision.
overall i am looking forward to see what the next lab experiments will be like for this level of physics.
i find this class really special and safe because theres such little people.
i also want them to know that chemistry isnt that scary or bad of a subject.
scientist have provided good ideas for us to create better future lives.
i do also think that im not here to just be a blob and not do anything productive in society as well as not do anything for my lifes purpose.
"i enrolled into the physics 112 lab course at sfsu, to complete a major requirement for general biology, however it is also required that i take physics 111 and thus is essential for me to take 112."
"actually, this class comes with the phy230 but whatever."
i am at san francisco state university to further my education in a field i enjoy.
"but somehow, i managed and before long, i found myself at san francisco state university, as a firstgeneration student."
"as for the topic itself, i dont think this is a class that i would voluntarily sign up for and the reason for this is because this class is, in my opinion, the most difficult physics class in the whole physics series."
"ive been in the workforce on the recruitment side, and in the bay area i see how recruiters skim resumes, and if a degree isnt on there, they go to the bottom of the pile."
"the reason why i am here in this physics 111 lab is technically because this class is a requirement for my major, environmental science."
"although i am interested in science now, her pushing me to do robotics did not affect that choice."
its really cool what we learn about the galaxies.
"however, currently i am feeling a bit lost with myself to be able to genuinely answer this question to be satisfied."
"on a larger scale, i am here because i graduated highschool, and am the first in my immediate family to go to college and further my education."
"my major is microbiology and to get my degree in that, i need to take this class."
"if i know the theory, the result and precision of the experiment would not matter to me, but these classes changed my mind a lot, it taught me that the influence of error and deviation can be big enough to let me get an experimental result contrary to the theoretical result."
"in the sense of answering why i am here in regards to the class, i am here because i would not have learned new material if i did not show up to the class."
i plan to transfer to san jose state to pursue my childhood dream of working with airplanes.
"i just dont know if all these biology courses would be great for me, i dont really do well in math and if the major needs math i might struggle."
stem subjects are exceptionally useful.
ive seen what good and bad doctors have done to people suffering from cancer and i would like to become someone that works in this field and treats their patients with care.
i am determined to get through school as fast as i can and try to get a good job in the engineering field straight out of school.
i am currently a biology major so i have no choice but to take it.
i dont really know why im here in this class.
"it was always in my head after k12, boom you go to college and become an ""adult""."
"i also often get lost in the material, and it helps me tremendously to have others bring focus back into what is important and what is being tested."
plus i am excited to learn how physics can apply to our lives or lab assignments.
it may even be associated with a spiritual intelligence.
i look forward to having a good and productive learning experience in lab to help me really grasp the concepts taught in lecture.
"the reason i believe that i am here is to help people, i believe that i was gifted with an extreme level of compassion for people and a strong desire to serve the populus i believe the best way that i can do that is through medicine and learning about the body."
i currently work at a physical therapy clinic at presidio sport and medicine and majority of the exercises that i prescribe my patients coincide with physics topicsanalogy.
i wanna find a place were i am able to gain a good amount of pay and also enjoy what i do.
understanding what i am learning means getting good grades for my major classes.
i will try my best and work very hard.
"but i am here now, so i would try my best in the class."
"aside from that, i love the lab environment and working through experiments."
"i like all the clubs the school has, the programs, and the internships."
"also, seminar was pretty much individualgroup work on packets and we never turned them in so i feel like having a seminar section was a whole waste of my time and it only brought my grade down."
having this degree is one of the major stepping stones in getting into medical school.
i am here in this class so that i can get extra practice of the topics that we learn from lecture.
si class provides help and support.
computer engineering degree is the perfect balance between the software and the hardware of the computer.
i am here literally because it is a requirement that i need for my undergrad.
i had many family members pass away before me due to multiple illness and diseases.
"she works two jobs to make ends meet; at least, that was her reason for not having time to join us."
"i would like to work in a job where the work i do has a direct impact on what the consumer receives, or building tools that are used internally in the company or even simply doing research that either reinforces concepts previously discovered or further exploring concepts that are still being theorized."
"i am in this class because i want a better grade in my class, i also want to get extra help so i can understand what i need to do rather than memorizing for the exams."
i get a sort of epiphany.
"the reason why im here is because my parents decided they want to have kids, and the sperm that won out of the other thousands that couldve made it, but ended up dying before they could, making me the winner and here right now on this day."
i am here to study computer science.
i have never taken physics so i am not exactly sure what to expect.
"manuel sotovernon wetzell phys 222.08 6 february 2020for 5 minutes, journal reflectively on:""why am i here?""this essay is meant to connect you to your purpose."
"therefore, my education and gradutating college, is not only my goal and dream, but it is also theirs."
i am here because i enrolled in the phy112 class.
"i also, have always been passionate about animals."
"also, i want to be here is to get more information to work on the subject better and it would help right after the class time to understand the topic better."
with my degree i plan to get a good career and pay off my loans.
but even though i was set for majoring in engineering i also wanted to do something with art so i also minored in it.
"science and medicine fascinate me, it opens my mind to reality that everything in is interconnected in different ways possible."
"another reason why im here is because if i dont take this classes, im not going to be able to move and do other classes that my major requires."
"due to my challenges with the subject.personally, chemistry has always been a difficult subject."
performing experiments and collecting data is something that i enjoy doing in any subject.
i am here because this class is a prerequisite for my kinesiology major.
i realized by taking the sci class i was able to get more help on understanding the concepts outside of the classroom and office hours.
i was always drawn towards sciences throughout my former schooling.
"math doesnt come so easily to me, so i hope that sci111 can explain things to me in simpler ways than our phys111 textbook."
my goal in life is to succeed and accomplish every goal i set for myself by the age of 60 years old.
ill become a better version of myself by increasing my knowledge.
however i have enjoyed going to lab because i did not get a chance to do many labs in high school physics.
the difference between heliocentric and geocentric theories and how one became to trusted as opposed to the other.
"i think it interests me because i don't want to be stuck in a job that i hate, i'd rather find my passion and do something that i love; so starting my own business would be something really challenging yet inspiring."
after taking chem 115 i learned a lot of information but i realized that chem 215 was going to be a little more challenging.
my grandaunt was a nurse in the philippines.
i have also never taken a physics course before and i'm very curious and interested in learning about what physics is.
"at this point, i don't 'need' a b.s. in c.s., but a: it would be better to have one than to not and b: this has been something i've been working for for just over 5 consecutive years."
"after all, hearing the statistics of 80 of sci students pass the parental class motivates me to part of sci 220."
"while this class is like three hours long it sometimes feels less, but then some feel long."
"i remember myself enjoying while doing physics numerical problems in high school, but its has already been couples of years now."
having such a large lecture class can be intimidating and its easy to feel like everyone understands it while youre falling behind.
this is why i want to go into the stem field because i can come in and change the faces i see and see more people like me and also create a change.
i am having fun learning about motion and how velocity and acceleration all work in the real world.
"as a kinesiology major, i need to fulfill many prerequisites and physics is just one of them."
i have absolutely no knowledge of physics coming to college since i never took it back in high school but i did take conceptual physics last fall.
as a engineer i need this class to get in to my classes.
i am here because i am a new transfer student to sfsu. i am a kin major and physics is one of my requirements.
"i have always been interested in the research side of science because i like being able to collect data, use that data to find something, and then see the results of that."
"i don't resent physics per say, i was just never very good at it when i take a look at my past experiences in academia."
i'm here because i want to be here.
these questions typically can all be answered through one reasoning since they all tend to tie in together in the end.
"i find it pretty hard to pay attention intently during class, so i didn't take ap physics, which led me to taking it now."
this motivates me to try my hardest to learn this material so it can help me later.
"despite my struggles, i want everyone to know that it is not easy."
"this makes me empathetic, understanding, and more mature."
also in the hilarious case that this question was specific to why am i in sci 111; i am here to learn and be social.
"however, i eventually was able to make it and work on my college degree."
"the stem field also seems like the type of field where ill always be learning, so hopefully it will be a fulfilling career path as well."
"i find out stem field actually can get in touch with some cool materials in lab, such as motors, generators."
this reflection only gets to show a little bit of my interest in the stem field.
"first of all, i am in this class to get as much help as i can with biology."
my end goal is to be able to have a good paying job that lets me live a happy life with a nice house and car and also be able to take care of my family and pay my parents back for everything they have done for me.
"why i showed up to class on this day (september 3rd, 2020) was because it;s only the second week of school and itd be kinda lame just to miss class because i want to and, i actually enjoy this class already, considering its only once a week, but everyone just seems pretty chill."
the reason i am taking phys 112 is because i need it for my phys 111 class.
hopefully we wont have quizzes because i believe lab should be about experiments and testing about physics.
ive spent my whole life being a student and i wouldnt want my life to be just dedicated to being a student.
i can remember from last semester when i took your class that i learned how to calculate error analysis and standard deviation.
"to begin with a little insight on why i am in san francisco is due to me wanting to be in a city environment when working towards my bachelors degree due to me originally coming from a similar environment, making it a bit easier to adjust."
"from many testimonies of celebrities and billionaires that have acquired everything, the one thing that is a staple in all of their stories is that, after acquiring everything, living a selfindulgent lifestyle is not satisfying."
this sparked a natural curiosity inside of me to pursue this knowledge further.
becoming an orthodontist is a very major part in my future and understanding sciences will help me lead to that path.
i am here because i have the opportunity to achieve something my parents were able to do.
the career field of physical therapy has interested me since before i got into this university so i decided to major in kinesiology to lead me to the right path.
but my current purpose on being alive is just to enjoy what life has to give me.
this class is one of the first classes towards the major you have to take(as long as its required to take when taking phys220).
and last but not least i am really looking forward to do some cool experiments and get a better understanding of physics.
i know that when working on these labs i will be able to get out of my comfort zone and ask for help whenever im confused or in need of assistance during the process.
she also showed me around her job site a bit which was very cool to see at a young age.
im not sure which one yet but i have narrowed it down to those three.
this class is a great way of studying and making friends that i can study with!
"thats why i am studying at sf state, because of the nice cinema program offered there."
i also just want to meet new people who are interested in the same things as me.
"i began as a history major at riverside city college, and by the time i arrived at uc riverside, i was a spanish major."
"i've studies with catholics, christians, jehovah witnesses, talked to muslums, mormons just to hear what they have to say."
i will try to do my best in this physics class so i will not have to retake it.
science that can help other people and prevent things such as cancer or other diseases.
"the general physics laboratory is required as a complement to the general physics course, and also to fulfill a general education requirement."
"in this physics course, i hope to learn more about taking what we learn in the lecture courses, and putting them into real life examples."
use what i learn and apply it in whatever career i pursue.
"as ownership of the mill changed, so did its practices and the activities of the mill causing its demise."
i decided to come to san francisco state university because i wanted to experience a new community.
i will try my hardest to be the best i can be while im here.
i hope im able to learn more about flux and etc.
"i have always been interested in astronomy, physics, and math, and being able to study those topics so i can apply what i learn later in life appeals to me."
"i am here xxx, yes i am here."
"being in that class and hearing the instructors focus in topics we were unsure about whether it was in the videos they posted on ilearn, or the kahoot games, or the practice tests we were given before an exam really helped me to have a better understanding of what was going on in the course."
i do not really believe in predestination or that we are here for a specific reason.
"this helps the therapist determine what someones range of motion is, how deep their injury goes, or how advanced they are in their therapy."
"my majors are philosophy and biology, with a concentration in physiology."
"i learned some basic physics knowledge through the first two lessons, and through experiments i learned the relationship between the direction of speed and distance."
i always been someone who enjoys helping other people learn math.
i would like to think we want positive things because i think thats part of the meaning of life.
also i really think physics is really awesome and i really like the labs we do.
i just hope i am able to pass the class because i definitely do not want to retake it.
"since i will need to perhaps take another class of physics after this semester, i wanted to fully understand the material as opposed to just completing the material so i can just complete the class."
because of that i have to make a lot effort to finish my degree and get a good job after school and give them a well living life.
i hope this class will help me understand more what i am doing in seminars and labs or even in the future.
i was also nervous for the length of the class.
another reason why i am here is because the laboratory section of physics will help me understand a bit more visually about physics.
im here because i feel it could contribute to my path for success.
i didnt do well in that class because ive never spent time trying to understand the concepts that were being taught and rarely asked the teacher for help.
"if i'm being completely honest, i'm really only here in this class to fulfill sf state requirements."
"come to think of it now, i kind of want to learn how to apply physics to other ideas of mine such as aerodynamics, energy generation, and thrust."
i tend to have a lot issues when it comes to the homework so hopefully taking this class would help me with that as well.
"im here in the astronomy 116 class because of all the general education lab choices, astronomy piqued my interest the most."
"if i were to be any other major, i would not be taking this class."
i wish to spread kindness throughout the world.
"as i always say to my friends, learning makes my brain get a little bit bigger from the knowledge."
i wanted to take this si class so that i can be more confident in my physics skills so that i dont have to focus as much on my grades.
i am here because i was born into a society that deemed it necessary to acquire higher education to obtain any resemblance of a good life.
to feel like we have a purpose.
"personally though, i feel i am here for a big purpose, because i have a big heart and want to make everyones life better."
"when i was reading the three body problem, there are many things that i cannot understand because of my lack of knowledge in the physics field."
i also enrolled in the lecture of astronomy this semester and i hope i am able to learn more about this topic and expand my interest and knowledge in astronomy.
i feel as though physics is also a class that relates to real world applications a lot.
"whether its anatomical or regarding the earth everything has an explanation, even the smallest thing and that never fails to surprise me."
"otherwise, i would have never taken this lab as it is a big chunk of my wednesday, and my time is very valuable."
it is also really humbling to learn about outer space.
"for example on physics 220 i learned a lot about gravity and how it affects physics, through that i can make a connection between physics and engineering such that how gravity affect building structures."
im here because i need this class for my general education.
those kids that i taught (ranged from the ages three through twelve) would hike three hours in the jungle every single week to stay in the dorms to get an education.
me being here is way more important than that though.
i never had the opportunity to take physics in high school or community college; my presence in this class is my first exposure to physics overall and i will admit it is absolutely terrifying.
i need help with even the most basic parts of physics.
"i have heard nothing but good things about these classes, and so far what i have heard is true."
theres so much that humanity hasnt discovered and to some people thats frightening.
i migrate to the usa with my brother to live a better life.
"i have taken sci classes before for bio 230 and 240 and they really helped me, especially when preparing for exams."
i hope to have a good study group so that we can all work on it together.
i don't know why i did not know that i haven't taken this class.
"i wanted to go to college around my home, i live about half hour away."
"also, write a journal in a short time give me a lot of pressure."
the last reason i chose to go to san francisco state university is that it was close to home.
i am here in physic 112 because it is a visual way for me to understand the concept of physic.
i am here because this course is going to take me a step further to getting my degree.
i'm here to pursue my aspiration of wanting to work in the medical field.
i am going to answer both.
"they should have listened to the scientist to make sure everyone in the country could be safe, but instead they chose to ignore them and tell us the people to ignore them as well."
"i dont know whether here refers to this class or this college, so i will answer both."
i want people to be comfortable even in difficult times and ill do whatever it takes in order for that to happen.
i joined sci for physics for many reasons.
though i must admit that i am really having a hard time understanding physics.
"i never even took a physics class in high school, so i am working with bare minimum knowledge of the subject."
i enjoy learning new things and pushing myself academically and i know this course will help with that.
"second, writing out lab reports, helps me learn a way to focus and organize my work in a way that can be used and aid anyone."
i also am here to be smart and finish my degree.
"leading into organic chemistry, you have to either be able to visualize the different molecules or be able to recreate it using a molecule kit."
"as a human the tendency of selfabsorption is an instinct, and to combat that would be going against our natural instincts as humans."
i also am here because i like to work hard and push my mind to its limits.
i am unsure if it could be the class structure or the material might be really that hard.
"hello, my name is nanxi huang and i am a college first year."
"however, im super excited to be enrolled at sfsu ."
these problems can be seen as practice for problem solving which allows someone who is in computer science like me to be able to think of a way to code something and solve it more efficiently through the problems we experience and experiment with in the lab.
it also helps me to express my creativity.
i know that it can get hectic and demoralizing when a section gets closed due to low enrollment.
i hope my existence affects others in a good way.
kinesiology is the study of mechanics of body movements.
including also the fact that we live in a place well known for innovations in the tech industry.
"i can't imagine myself doing the same for this class, and i also don't even know where i would start."
"although expensive, its definitely worth it in my opinion, at least to go to college to."
physics is one of the basic sciences i need to learn about since it is useful in understanding how much force a patient is able to exert or in measuring a range of motion.
"i've kind of fallen behind because the 8am lectures, i can barley retain information during that time or i will sometimes miss, so that is why i am taking sci 115."
thats not a abritaray number.
i am here because this is a lower division requirement for computer science.
"i recently switched my major from computer science to business, and im taking the prerequisites this semester."
it also makes more sense because a lot of concepts we can visualize and experience in our day to day life.
"it confused me at first, but soon i was able to catch up."
i wouldnt take this course if it werent on the pathway to biochemistry.
"i am here taking this class because i am genuinely interested in being a scientist, though."
i feel this way when i have no idea what is going on in my life and i am just left with a bunch of unanswered questions.
"its truly not that bad, the positives of my job far outweigh the negatives."
i would prefer not to go to school and learn on the job but despite my preference i have to go to school in order to live a life of drawing layouts and floorplans.
because this is an online course this semester i do not quite know how all of that is going to work but i am optimistic.
"when someone came in and started to explain what it is and how it can really help you out, i figured why not."
i became fascinated with managing projects and wanted to learn more about it apart from the bluecollar aspect of the job.
why am i currently in this physics course?
"i am here for the free samples at costco, hot chocolate with crunchy marshmallows on a rainy day, the chika chika during family parties, and of course my baby mushi."
i am prekin and need to take physics in order to finish off my prerequisites and make sure i do get accepted by the kinesiology association.
i would hope to learn about mental illness and destigmatize those who are victims of stereotypes.
"but at the end of the day, i try to take it day by day because i know i overwhelm myself with things."
i believe the human experience is to build and develop a purpose in our lives beyond our primal instincts using the complex minds that we were gifted with.
taking this course is a part of my requirements for my major which is physiology.
"the reason i am majoring in bio, is because i think into whatever field i go into i can make a difference."
"not only having a good grade is the goal in this class, but to be able to gain the knowledge and the tools to help me in the long run."
im in phys 111112 because it is a class i will have to take for my major.
i took honors physics in highschool and i remember struggling a lot in the class but i enjoyed the challenge.
i slowly became aware that san francisco is not where i see myself in the future but i am still here to gain the experience of loving somewhere new on my own and accepting the challenge of being independent.
at first i thought that physics is more like math.
"when i think of the question ""why am i here?"", multiple interpretations pop up in my head."
students know the difference between theory and purpose.
so for chemistry i just want to relearn the basics because the last time i took chemistry was my junior year in high school.
it is to look at a flower and understand where the colors come from etc this quote might not be exact but its pretty similar to what i remember.
i believe every single person is here only to have impact on others.
we actually get to see how things really work and see why they might work the way they do.
"i was able to learn the topic better and when it was time to go to class, i felt like i knew what the professor was talking about and was able to help my friends that arent part of the sci class."
maybe i don't know.
"i am here because i am in my third year at sfsu, but it doesnt really feel like it because time flew by so fast."
but i am also here because i am working towards my biology degree and this class happens to be the one that i didn't take during my freshman and sophomore year.
the reason why i chose specifically this type of science because i have never taken this type of science in my education life.
i also like hearing from different people on how they are learning the material because it might also help me.
"i really appreciate the time the instructors take to teach this class because it must be hard for them too, being students."
i am also here because i would like to create study groups from those who are also in my class.
this is a great way to help my gpa as well as give me the knowledge i need in order to do better in my class.
i am also sure that this class will be able to help with my other classes in the future.
i am here because i am supposed to be here.
"and as my major; mechanic engineer, i wanna get started on labs and its procedure; the actual hands on learning."
"once my health started improving, i dedicated my focus to advancing my school and future career aspects."
something ive been wanting to do for a long time and that is go to work and helping animals out as a veterinarian.
i think it is important to learn this to be able to explain whats going on around us.
through them i was able to learn from school but from myself that i can succeed.
"however, i have really enjoyed it so far."
"im here because i made certain decisions in life, but also because i was put in certain positions in life."
it is required to concurrent enroll in physics 222.
"this semester i feel lucky that im happy with all of my professors, i remember ive had some notsopleasant experiences with some."
it seems never ending and thats what i find so crazy.
"i can feel it, but i can not put my finger on it yet."
i am here in this class because this course really helps in boosting gpas and helping me stay on track with studying.
"i thought while i am taking the main physics class, i should take the lab along with it."
"dont get me wrong though, i have taken physics before in high school and earned a really good grade and actually felt like i enjoyed learning about the topic and the many ways that it relates to my every day life around me."
"sci 121 is also a good class for me because it fits my schedule and i can get free help like packets, tutoring and exam previews for one extra credit."
i am the type of person that truly believes knowledge is power.
"every year, new technologies create unprecedented job opportunities."
even lab is rough.
"i took the jc route; college tuition was too expensive, and it was just economically better for me to go to a junior college."
"although times and opportunities have significantly, i still see university as the gateway to at least a stable job in the engineering field."
"even though i am still uncertain about my career path, i have to keep moving on and through each semester, although this semester is unlike anything i've ever had before."
ultimately i am here so i can have a better future.
"now whenever i look out at the night sky, i can spot that planet."
i am hoping that this class is a little bit easier but so far i am slightly struggling also with my other classes which is chemistry 115 and stats so there is a lot of math i need to do and know.
the same can be said about asterisms and constellations to me.
while i wouldn't consider physics my strong suit it is undeniable that the same forces at play both macro micro are what have lead to the universe we find ourselves in.
i am also here because i love science and learning about it.
i want to take this class now because im trying to graduate in three years but since i added minor in math and astronomy idk if that will happen.
my initial thought when hearing this question is why was i born and what is my purpose?
my major is mechanical engineer which requires me to have a lot of math classes along with physics.
it is something that i have aspired to be for a while now and achieving it would be life changing for me.
"i truly have a passion for science and its studies but i always tend to find myself struggling, but i rather struggle and learn rather than to know straight from the point."
"furthermore, having someone to study with gives me more motivation than studying by myself."
"i am not a huge science fan, but it has started to grow on myself as i have been moving on with my journey."
physics thought me how to change my bad habit.
"although there are some aspects i still find confusing im enjoying it so far, as well as attending school away from home."
it should be streamofconciousness writing from the heart.
not just one computed reaction when someone says hello to you.
"while in high school i was deciding between 3 school, but ultimately picked here."
i can do algebra and what not but when it comes to calculus it just gets really difficult.
i have grown up around some of the most selfless people i know.
"speaking of school, i feel that im here to learn as much as i can so i can get a major and hopefully find a job."
"science classes could be really fun sometimes, especially the lab experiments, but mostly, lab experiments can be scary since you might be working with very harmful chemicals."
"in the beginning, i started playing flash games online which transitions into more serious games on steam."
i'm working so in the future when it's time to go back to in person school i have money to pay bills and such.
physics never ceases to stun me whenever i think about it.
"they had my older brother, and went back to panama and had me."
and so forth.
i am a mechanical engineering major due to my passion for science and mathematics in school along with my hobbies in automobiles.
"like you're not even a little bit interested in this?""."
i am extremely grateful that i get to learn not only biology but also the basic elements that apply to the natural world.
that being said i havent decided what major i like.
luckily i also enjoy physics and learning about physics so i am glad i am able to take this class.
i feel that enginnering sharpens our skills and makes us more efficient in term of finding solutions for different kind of problems.
i could answer it in many different ways.
i met him while we were both enlisted in the us air force.
i am a student athlete and i also work so this class being once a week and on a wednesday was super convenient for me.
as for life purpose for why i am here is simply going with the flow.
"anyways, i do appreciate the time and effort that the sci instructors put into this class because i do see a difference in my understanding of quantitative chemistry."
i started working right out of high school and it took me a few years to really gain the motivation to go back to school and transfer from my community college.
i want to be able to be remembered when i die from more than just my friends and family.
"my reason for san francisco state university is that it was originally started as a teachers college and although it isnt one anymore, it still has a wonderful teaching program."
physics on the other hand is a very confusing subject for me but i think it is very important in understanding how things work.
this helps in getting things done.
my purpose is to just be successful in whatever it is i put my mind to and to work especially hard to see that success very clich answer but it is very true.
this class hopefully will help me understand those forces and allow me to better help a patient.
"i don't like doing the easy project, it is the main reason i didn't go to class last semester because i can know the result without doing a test in most of the projects."
i also want to learn more about physics on how the subject relates to the world around us.
i asked myself that for the first time in seventh grade.
"going to college and doing well will give me more opportunities, jobs obviously but also more experience in so many ways and last but not the least enough money to start my own family someday."
"i think that is what the meaning of life is, not to get too existential, but the true meaning of life is to give life your own meaning, deliver a happiness relative to your own perspective."
i'm here to accomplish the basics i need in order to move along and to be able to expand my learning in this subject of science.
"during this class, i work with my partner."
i am also here because i signed up for this class last summer but i was already taking summer classes and it was too much with work.
i am here at this science 321 supplemental class for chemistry 321 so that i can hopefully improve my performance in chem 321.
but yeah i'm here because i currently don't wanna work construction.
"after thinking for awhile, she told me to read the books on planets because they were, kind of similar. listening to her instructions, i began to read about jupiter, mars, and saturn."
another reason why i joined this class was thanks to another peer who recommended i join since we already were in the same chme 180 class.
"my worst subject has always be math, so i thought that maybe by taking the sci class it would help me to improve my math skills."
but as we look further death is going to be upon us.
also sometimes the physics question are really vague and i hope sci can help clear them up for me.
"i feel that i'm here because i am that dedicated to make sure that i learn the material thoroughly, and that means taking an extra class to do better in another one."
i decided to take this class this semester because i am also taking biology and physics.
"i am physically here because sf state was one of the few schools that were not too far from home, but far enough and had an electrical engineering program."
i do not have a strong background in mathematics and i know that physics incorporates many concepts found in math.
i expect to learn a lot from this by the end of the course.
i really want to keep learning.
because i'm stressed about physics and i have no idea what's going on in class.
i was never good at physics and usually get very frustrated.
"school is a great tool, but it focuses too much on testing your knowledge in a standardized way rather than making the information easily digested and enjoyed."
"personally, i think physics as a course is wonderful in high school because the topics were interesting."
i grew up with my parents always influencing me that i should be in the medical field.
the lab component of physics has been helpful in a way where the instructor there is more approachable and willing to help...which i truly appreciate.
i am also here because i love learning.
i have to take these courses because its a requirement for all biology majors.
more specifically i would like to be able to thrive not just survive.
"therefore, i hope i can do well in this class."
we need more people in this field because the earth is really a beautiful place and it really needs help.
"silverio floresreflective journal essay 1 why am i here?hello, my name is silverio (silver) flores, i am a firstgeneration college student."
im here to make my future brighter to improve myself.
doing biology and cinema will hopefully allow me to make wildlife documentaries and raise awareness to issues i care about.
i enjoy math because i've always been good at it.
the only interest i have in physics doesn't include the calculations necessarily but more so the ideas that we prove or disapprove to explain how something works in physics just surprises me.
sometimes home can be nice but there are also moments where home can become too much.
well why does anyone pursue a higher education?
"i am here in this lab because, honestly, there wasnt any other lab that was available for me to take."
"i am eager to delve into research and development, using my biology, philosophy and risk management professional skills in lifesciences."
"i'm here because, according to the bachelors of computer science degree requirements, i need phys 232."
i just want to be here becaouse i can and i dont want to waste my oportunity to be somone in this world.
thats why i'm here
"so yea, i'm not even really sure why i'm legit here."
"i have worked very hard, both mentally and physically to get where i am today."
they are short in women doctors there and many children die during birth because they are being born at home.
i can do fine if i am given numbers and an equation but if any part of the problem is missing then i have trouble.
"by learning physics, we can improve the ability, deduction. for example, elon musk can make cheap rockets from the deduction."
but i am here and going to do my best to overcome my weaknesses and fears!
after i graduate i don't know what i really want to do.
i recently learned in philosophy about why were here and what makes a meaningful life.
i was to pass and do well in this class even though i know nothing about science and my past experiences with science classes have been bad.
"i haven't figured out my minor yet but hopefully, it will be something like comm or something in the humanities."
"its getting to be too much, but thats college."
"i dont mean just know how to use a concept or memorize it, but i actually mean fully understanding the material being taught to me."
any knowledge that subtly relates to my passion interests me so i am glad that i am here.
"overall i would say that i enjoy learning, and college is the time to indulge in any subject you please."
"all of this will be possible because of my success, and as of right now, i am on this path because i am here right now, looking forward into a brighter and better future."
"for this spring semester, i knew that i wanted to take another sci class, so my previous sci instructors recommended sci 240 to me."
"they were so excited during my orientation, more excited than me."
"there are also various geopolitical consequences that will result from these emerging situations, e.g. the arab spring revolt, melting of arctic seas and possible new avenues for conflict with opening of ocean territory."
"when i think about the people i look up, the people i strive to be, i think of them."
"the labs so far are pretty cool, although they tire me out a little bit and can be somewhat confusing."
i am a very shy person but i get used to talking to the people around me in a few days.
i like to hold and test ideas that we are learning in class in hopes to boost and fully grasp my understanding of the subject.
i am at san francisco state because it was my second choice school and the first choice didn't work out.
i used to think that physics experiments were just for theory verification.
"so far, i am having some troubles with understanding some of the labs, which gets frustrating for me."
"however, as i said before, i do enjoy physics."
"i am hoping that this course will be different, and will go more in depth to know how certain things work."
im hoping i will also be applying the concepts i learned to in real life examples.
however i never considered it as a major for me only a hobby or side interest.
understanding how physics is involved in our everyday life gave me a better perspective.
i hope that these classes help me understand more of what i need to know in order to graduate.
"physics to me also is fun and not ""hard,"" but its like the concepts are fun, but the work is hard."
i took physics in high school and i can definitely say that it was my least favorite subject so i wanted to take this class in case i am having trouble.
biology was not my strongest subject as i thought to believe and chemistry was a disaster with earth science being something old and not new.
"28, 2020so the reason why i wanted to sign up for the sci courses is because i need help on the side line in order to refresh my skills from high school."
"i think there a lot of things that could be reasons of why i am here. one, i think i have gone through hardships and experiences that most people never will."
paul saini chemistry 115 21820 chemistry 115 i am a punjabi and i am from the bay.
a lot of people who start out in the stem field drop out because they realize how difficult it actually is and that it requires hard work and dedication.
"i have began to open my mind to the idea of becoming well acquainted with physics, even though i am scared of how hard it might be."
i suppose the second reason why im here is just for the extra support im case if i need it since these are some hard classes so it wouldn't hurt to just take them.
i strongly dislike physics and it's one of those classes that i feel like i barely pass.
"i took ap physics in high school and physics with calculus last year, and even though for the most part, plugging and chugging was what i was geared to do."
hopefully learning physics again would be easier but i don't know since this is a collegelevel class.
"more specifically, this class will get me one step closer to my career goal because this class is one of the required classes for my major."
so far lab 1 in its virtual state was successful and i was able to understand the fundamentals of what it was getting across.
i hoped to find more internships around sf but since covid began there haven't been many opportunities lately.
i've only taken one class that was related to physics which was in my junior year of high school.
do we have to be educated on topics were never even using again?
"it applies to just about everything in my daily life, especially subjects like math and science."
"sometimes when things in life don't go as planned, i always have to reflect on why i'm even here in the first place."
i have had some academic struggle when i was young and now have found a path that feels fulfilling.
i mean my mother wouldn't have been on a boat for 2 weeks for me to not work hard for a better life.
physics has been my weakness since middle school.
it is sad and i think being at home makes me sad.
i can use the information i gain here in reallife scenarios and maybe even a future job.
the former has many draw backs as i am easily distracted and my time management skills are not fully developed.
im also here because i love the sciences.
this is my second semester of physics and do i like it?
biology has also been a really interesting topic and i learned that i'm actually good in those courses even though in high school i didn't do too well in those courses.
i am here for multiple reasons.
"hi,i too ended up at sfsu because i was rejected from a few of the other schools that i applied too."
"so clearly, whereverwhatever i was goingdoing is not where i was supposed to be."
"kelsey hauf reflective journaling 1""why am i here?"" i am here in this class because it is a requirement in order for me to get into the next physics class and any other class where this is a prerequisite."
i heard from my cousin who attended college in china said that they started taking physics class in middle school and the physics class they took at college was at a more advanced level than the one i am taking now.
this is a big challenge because i do not know a lot about physics and i'm learning through a computer screen.
if there was a program to only focus on veterinarian medicine i would do that instead as i believe having a focus on something would greatly increase the improvement of learning and understanding of a subject.
in this sci class i am comfortable asking whatever i need to ask.
"physics is a basic subject, which reveals many basic problems in our life and is very helpful to our daily life."
the why is making the most of my opportunities where ever i am at because going to college is a blessing that i'm grateful for.
and my advisor recommended i shouldn't take any more regular classes because chem 115 and biol 240 are hard classes already and im taking them together.
this sums up the the purpose of me being here.
i am not sure how lab would operate during online classes but hopefully it would be great.
ever since then really i have been interested in space.
now i'm just here trying to pass my classes so i can have a degree so i don't feel like i'm wasting my life.
i feel like i focus better and learn better in general when classes are in person.
why am in phys 112?
i was always a good academically in high school.
i can help maintain the world by working.
my math professors have all told me that calculus 2 is a lot harder than calculus 1 so i want to make sure that i am not falling behind.
"its the most important that, i think my practice ability also have a increase to a degree."
i am here because i am a general biology major at san francisco state and this is one of my requirements for my major.
"i'm not sure how long i'll be in san francisco or this school but i believe right now, this is the right choice for me and my character."
i find the subject of astronomy to be very fascinating because i am always wondering how things work like in physics when you learn about gravity and light refraction.
i hope this alma journal doesn't sound very repetitive.
i am here because i need to take a lot of science courses to get to the career that i want.
"i have already taken conceptual physic for my kinesiology major, but i needed general physic to be able to apply for the physical therapist program."
reaching 150 words is rough so maybe make these little journals a minimum of 100 words.
"back in high school i had fun in biology, and in the cell department actually, so that might be a second option for me."
with this one unit i now am taking fifteen units and that is perfect.
also i like to know how things work around us either be physics or engineering.
"in this present moment, i am building myself up through education and experiences so that later in my life, i will be able to contribute to the personal growth of others and help them through their endeavors.(note: i apologize for the late submission."
i also need physics for a prereq for my major because it is required.
i also have had sleeping problems for the past year or so and i have been trying to work on myself mentally and physically because theres a lot i need to fix.
i am going to answer why i am at sfsu because i feel like that is something i have figured out.
general physics will be highly related to my major kinesiology as well.
it is an ongoing process.
"there is no need to commute, which saves time and money."
i hope to shape stem and have stem shape me.
i am at san francisco state university (sfsu) to obtain a cell and molecular biology bachelors major.
i had a pretty strong aversion to taking a physics class.
"surrounding my major, i decided to go to sf state and stay home because it would help me save money and allow for me to think bigger for med school and be able to go away."
im taking chemistry because it required for my major(biology) and i know it is something i very much it is something very much included in biology.
every time i have to spend more effort and time to understand the physics concept and finish my homework.
"thus, the reason why i am here is continue my journey of learning mistakes and my experiences and pass them along the way."
"additionally, i signed up for this class because i need an a (lowest a b) in this class because this class is a prerequisite for physical therapy school."
"i was a little nervous about this lad class when it stared, because three were math equations to kindof scared me a little it, but its a bit better now."
if it is all around us we should understand its existence and the purpose that it brings us.
once i complete that i am a step closer into graduating.
"with regards to attractive and repulsive forces, this knowledge could explain more complex devices and allow me to think more critically about the machines used in everyday life."
"i have to take another physics classafter i finish this one.also, why am i at this particular school?"
"i think i have changed the life of all my friends and family, whether it is for the better or the worse, i have had a big impact."
i'm here at san francisco state university because this is the only thing i could do.
i have had the same problem with school since i was a child and that is to stay focused on myself and my future.
"and with that, i am done."
"this does not mean im not interested in physics, in fact besides biology physics is a close second on my top interest in school."
general education has been a breeze.
"i believe that everyone in the world can learn by giving attention to the ideas, cultures, and opinions of others because it can be a valuable contribution to ones way of thinking."
or i can try to find better or cleaner ways to harvest energy.
i took sci classes before and they really help me to succeed in these courses.
so the reason im in this course is to help me pass the main course.
it never feels like work and i get excited to learn more.
so i am excited to be taking it again but a little nervous since i have not dealt with this subject in like 3 years.
"i don't talk to much, but i am always listening and learning as much as possible."
"by doing physics lab, we can relate equations to our lab observations."
i am here because i really want to know if biology is my passion.
why does it have clouds?
taking classes that i have never taken before in highschool frightens me.
"along with this, sci is also an easy way for me to get an a and boost my gpa."
i struggle with trigonometry and i know that is a skill i must have in physics.
i have to learn and master what were taught in physics to pass our incredibly difficult class with a somewhat high statistical failure rate.
having a change from having the beach literally right next to you and living in a city that's an absolute bubble to a city thats filled with diversity and using transportation is a huge change for me.
my goal is to get into the riptides program for my masters.
not right now at least.
i became more interested when i took anatomy and decided that i would like to become a physical therapist for children and working for a childrens hospital someday.
does purpose define life?
i have to say i'm a little behind on graduating on time but it's okay because everyone has their own paths.
"being biracial has been a huge part of my identity and experience of who i am growing up and so learning that sfsu was so hyperaware (example, i took a mixed race identity class) was a huge reason why i love sfsu. also"
being at san francisco state university is an opportunity to expand my learning and experience a new environment that would enable me to endure the challenges that come ahead as an adult.
i am eager to achieve for a deeper understanding of physics.
i need this class to be able to take the other classes that i need to for my biology classes.
"however as of right now, i think lab 116 is not so bad."
she did not know how to teach the students in a way that we would be able to learn the concept.
money is man made.
my major goal is to run my own practice and to serve people the holistic side of healthcare and not only be limited to western medicine.
the reason i am taking general physics is because it is part of a prerequisites for my biochemistry major.
to answer this i go back all the way to when i was six years old playing one of my favorite video games super mario world on the gameboy advance.
overall taking this class and so many other labs its not bad i mean i dont usually do good but it does help you learned new things that you havent before and thats something im trying to expend my mindset and what i can get out of in order to help me in the long run.
at the moment i just hope that i can get enough studying in for my test next week!
i am in this lab section to complete the lab requirement of phys 230 to proceed with the rest of my academic learning.
"i have taken a physics class previously in high school, but looking back i didnt really learn much and did not understand the full concept of what physics actually was and the point of it."
"going to college isnt only for ones self either, as having a college education will help anyone provide for their potential families they may have some day."
i am here to learn and follow the path of a computer science major the concepts i learn in physics wont necessarily help me in my field but physics tells you how good you are at forming logical explanations to problems and how do you tackle them which is very important for computer science majors.
"i am here taking astronomy lab 116, at san francisco stateuniversity because astrology was a big part of my upbringing throughout child hood, being raised in a spirtitual home."
it sucks it just makes us look extremely weird and not smart at all.
i never thought i had an option not too.
i see physics labs as a better way of learning physics.
my very first semester at san francisco state university i took a total of 3 sci courses and it was my best semester gpa to date.
i am here mostly to get my lower division requirements over with.
ive taken and sci class before and every time i participate in asking questions i always do better on exams and on homework.it is also reassuring knowing that im not the only one who is like what are we doing in class sometimes.
i am currently enrolled in physics 112 laboratroy because it is a degree requirement for my major.
"so knowing that, i changed my career to nursing."
it took a few bumps in the road to get my stuff together and choose a major but i'm grateful it happened.
"i am here to help others, to share my knowledge and learn from others as well."
"i am here because i need physics for my degree, but i do also enjoy learning and experimenting with physics."
"i knew that i wouldnt allow myself to end up impoverished, victimized, or addicted."
learn something too.
i am here because i want a successful life.
"and i believe that comparing with getting the predicted results after experiments, the physical spirit of daring to experiment repeatedly and strive for truth is what i admire and want to learn."
"as a matter of fact, i believe we have multiple purposes in life since we go through many different kinds of transitions."
"because we have a lot of physical knowledge in our life, so it is necessary to learn physics."
"i also want to get a better educations, get a better job, prferably one with advancement opportunities."
"a very long amount of time has passed since i took a physics course, i havent taken physics since freshman year of high school."
why am i here? is a weird question to me.
i'm here in physics lab because i need to take this lab for my requirement for kinesiology .
and i like how open we are and the teachers are really good.
going back to high school brings back really bad memories.
"ive got to say one things though, we are so much inferior compared to a lot of things in this universe, even on our planet."
"with an education in computer science and a long cultivated skill in narrative capability, i am in a better position to create than ever before."
"so like how am i suppose to pick one concentration and follow through with it, if i love being involved with multiple things."
i can also talk about my purpose as to why am i here on earth.
i want to be an obgyn. i heard my major is really tough but i like to challenge myself.
"because i am a freshman, i didnt realize that i needed to be in a lab along with my physics class, so it was a bit of a struggle to get into it."
"i can understand xus lectures just fine and it makes sense when he walks us through our problems and worksheets, but when it comes to our homework, i end up getting less than about 60 and it does not teach you how to do the problems when you get them wrong."
after she left i was very depressed and didnt do very well in some of my classes.
majoring in this has made me think about the so called leaders (politicians) of our country and their stances against climate change.
when i first heard the presentation in my physics class i found it super interesting.
i wanted to go to this school because i have always wanted to move out and be on my own.i have always liked san francisco so i thought it would be a nice place to live while i finished school.
"""why am i here?""such an abstract question; why am i here on this earth right now?"
"i originally came for journalism, but too one class and absolutely hated it."
i have heard that the course itself is intense.
"in my case, being part of a university has never been a want but a need since i started studying."
"while spending so much time trying to teach physics with calc last semester to myself, i struggled immensely with gen chem 2 ."
"with environmental science, i will be working to understand the earth and its terrestrial components."
"however, the lecture course i am currently in makes it difficult to grasp the concepts."
i do enjoy this subject mostly because it explains certain everyday motions.
after all my major is biochemistry and if i can not understand the simple foundations of it then i how can i overcome the most difficult parts of chemistry.
"as for physics, i am interested in understanding the laws of motion, and how it plays a role in our everyday life."
when i originally came to sfsu i didn't really have a good grasp on what i wanted to do for my major.
i am taking these classes to fulfill my requirements needed to get into the graduate program in order to become a physical therapist.
basically my main point in being in this class is to get more practice in and to make me less nervous in solving certain problems.
i believe that god created me for a purpose of creating compassion.
"also, i am excited to meet some of my classmates as some of them may have more knowledge about physics than i do so they can possibly help out if i don't understand something before i ask you."
i am a firm believer that you cannot go as far in life without an education because of how much more competitive people are becoming and that employers would rather go for someone that has a degree rather than someone who dropped out.
i guess it is important to know about physics because it happens in our daily lives.
a lot of topics in phys 230 are hard and a lot newer.
i am grateful for everything they have done and will do to get me where i need to be.
so far i am kind of getting what's going on in class.
"honestly, the only question i do know the answer to is why im talking a sci class."
i am in this class because it is a requirement for my major.
"i can go on for a while abou t her sub par teaching ; to put it in perspective, the class st arted with about 50 students, and event ually it trickled down to about 15 by the 2nd half of the seme ster."
i work as a physical therapist aide.
"physics, chemistry, biology and other scientific subjects need to be applied to it in order to figure out problems in the real world."
"further, with a solid foundation in physics, i can get a higher score on the mcat exam."
"simply put, i chose this class because it not only interesting but because its required to get my degree, no harsh feelings."
"if i learn basic physical properties and concepts here, then i can most likely use what i learned to understand physiology."
"i pushed off taking the lab for a couple semesters because of it, but now that i took this class i'm pretty happy i did."
stem careers have a lot of work to do.
"jennyfer vasquez physics 112sept 2, 2020 why am i here ?this is actually a really really good question, currently i am doing zoom meeting and class schedules from outta town, and its a bit hard todo so with not so great internet."
relationships are incredibly important to me.
learning more about physics should be very interesting and can relate to our environment.
i am here for multiple of reasons.
"at that time, the general concepts were not difficult for me to understand."
ive took sci in the past and realized it is also a really great way to make new connections from which you can form study groups or just friends in general.
i also took this class because i needed 12 units for this semester and i need to pass calculus 1 in order to get more of my major classes of engineering so that is one of the major reasons why i am here.
i was first brought in the stem field when my mother brought me a book about the solar system and the formation of the planets and moons in the solar system.
"but if i am being honest, i am okay with just knowing that it exists."
however i truly do enjoy learning about physics and all its aspects and i hope to continue learning about physics and its wonders in the future.
"this is my first time ever taking physics, which is pretty scary to me but very interesting at the same time."
what i liked about it was that we were able to work on projects that reflected what we were learning in class.
"however, i think understanding physics is integral in understanding biology so im glad im learning this information."
but i'm fearing that all the workload has turned me off from my inspirations as well because i am not well adjusted to it as of now.
at first i looked at computer engineering but i had already spent 2 years in school and didn't want to necessarily want to give myself a total of 8 years of school (and debt).
otherwise why i am here in the school is cause this school has good opportunities in the bay area or surrounding areas with ucsf and stanford near by if i want to do any internships or go to conferences to learn about their grad programs or attend some cool activities they would host.
"however i do enjoy taking physics labs, they are probably my second favorite lab class to take next to biology."
i always wanted to remain in a city since i come from a city which should not make me feel different or homesick.
civil engineering deals with the physically and naturally built environment.
i want to take sci because ochem ii the first time was difficult to understand from the start and was a lot of information to grasp onto.
this attempt is a little better where the instructor is not moving as fast or is she as boring.
i am very willing to sacrifice a lot of time to contribute to something bigger.
"the labs are going to be more focused on the concepts rather than focusing on the visuals of the experiment, and im looking forward to what is has to offer."
and now i enjoy it quite a lot.
i overall want to take this class to make sure that i do well in physics 111 the way that it helped me do well in my chem 115 class.
i am here because i have class and because i have a lot of other responsibilities to attend.
"for example, while a systems net force is not equal to zero, it occurs acceleration by the newton's 2nd law."
i am hoping that i am able to do well and succeed in this class so i can take the second part of physics.
or why am i in this class?
"it scares me, but i love it."
other than college i wouldnt know what to do.
why am i herei am here in this sci class because i am striving for the best possible grade in the parent class i can get and i believe this sci course is critical in helping me attain this grade.
i am still trying to find a connection between physics and biology.
this class was a requirement in my major which is why i am here taking it.
"i am here because for the past 17 years of my career, i've dedicated my literal blood, sweat and tears as a cook and now as a chefowner of a restaurant."
"i will be the solution instead of problems, and this goes for me being in college, or my personal life, or any job."
i want the people whom i care about around me to feel my gentle compassion in many different ways...
what matters is that we still live life in a moral and ethical manner.
"nevertheless, i am a big fan and i enjoy doing math based things."
"thinking from an evolutionary perspective, my purpose in life is to pass off my dna and produce offspring in order to keep my family tree going."
"after taking some physics classes, i have noticed that we can apply many of it to everyday life and use it on the daily without noticing."
i just wish the class was longer bc if you sit in the back you are screwed.
"overtime, i have come to enjoy the labs and look forward to them in my courses."
i really want to be the best scientist i can be and very much use my time wisely while i am in school to achieve and to strive far in school just like everyone else.
im hoping by the end of this course i can take what i learned and use it in my next physics course.
the teachers are nice so that makes the experience better.
just to name chemistry intimidates me because of past situations ive had with past teachers but thats the reason why i chose to take sci 115 so i can overcome the intimidation and to show myself that i can do it.
i am awake now at 9:30am because i picked classes i require for my degree.
i have been going to philz coffee shop to study for two hours on mondays just to get in as much information as well as prepare for the upcoming week by doing the self assessment quizzes.
"i think that even though i am a biology major, knowing physics allows me to become a well rounded individual and that majorly reflects the medical field."
"i suppose that is a major curiosity of mine, which is how objects interact."
"i would like to learn about the calculations and how it applies to the class, and understand to do it on my own and use the material i learn and apply it to my life outside of school."
im here because i still confuse on when to use derivatives and when to use antiderivatives.
"lastly, as an engineering major i hope to get valuable information that can provide me with a better understanding of engineering in general in the work life and possibly even in the future if i choose to pursue a masters degree."
"every step that i take comes with a purpose, and nevertheless, every step that i take backwards comes with a consequence."
"in irvine, everything is the same and the people here all have similar backgrounds and viewsideologies."
i am happy to be part of this university as well as this city.
"meanwhile, at this class, i'm going to experiments regarding the physics hypothesis and theories alongside my groupmates."
i then declared a major in psychology and realized that it was not really the subject for me.
taking physics 121 and 122 is the second level of my physics requirement to complete my minor.
i am a handson learner so this is the best learning experience for me.
the reason why i am here is because i take any opportunity that will aid me in my future to reach my career.
for this astronomy class i took because i find it fascinating about whats outside in space.
taking online labs will be something that requires extra attention.
today i am here because as a commuter i am not always able to use the campus resources to fit my schedule and since this fits my schedule i am using this class a support class that helps me summarize the materials taught in class in details.
there are two major reasons why we are here on this earth.
"to be quite honest, i do not know what my purpose in life is."
i think that i am here because this is the path that god lead me down and i am very grateful.
"i never really put that much thought to it until my high school years and that's when i really questioned everything around me, after watching movies like the matrix and other scifi movies that involve a simulation type of world it really just like opened my eyes to everything."
i do not want to be stumped on a problem because i cannot imagine what it is supposed to look like or what it is meant to represent.
i think the reason ive always liked science is because theres never a moment where it doesnt fascinate me.
i am also here because i love learning and think that physics is super interesting.
"specifically to me, my reasons for being here now have change."
it may not be the most ideal semester of learning but it all we have right now so i have to push as hard as i can to do the best that i can.
i don't know why i'm here to be completely honest.
this class also allows us to concentration on the topics we did not understand in the class.
for three years i have been struggling to find my way and my purpose in this school.
"i love that science is an everlasting wheel of information, its a field that will always grown and expand."
my first year of college i struggled a lot.
"that being said, i wouldn't be here if i didn't believe that this is where i should be."
"i was inspired by a woman who, against the norms of her era, chooses to rescue, forgive, and be generous to those in need."
"i felt that the biology 230 sci class, that i took last semester, was extremely helpful in helping me pass the biology 230 lecture and lab class."
that's why i am here.
hopefully i can find a purpose but as of now im not so sure what it is.
why im here i am here because of my career goal.
i have always believed that my sole purpose on this earth was to help others.
this means that i dedicate my life to learning in the sense that learning will never end.
"from what im told, sci was an additional class student could take to, improve gpa, gain additional help, and gain extra credits."
"i am currently in my 2nd year, and i plan to have my 120 credits achieved by the end of my 4th year, in 2022."
"we are here to have an amazing, meaningful life that can be contributed to society."
i am in physics to also take physics 222 to help with my knowledge for my major.
i don't actually know how much this kind of physics that we are doing is going to help me in robotics.
my major is biology with a concentration in physiology.
it all started ever since i got injured playing basketball.
"this way, i can stay motivated on my track towards my possible career choice."
"i owe everything to her, my life, every opportunity that i've had would not exist because of her and i think i will spend my entire life trying to show her that everything she's done has been worth it and meaningful."
i believe education is the key to those doors.
i am here taking this si class because i'm afraid of not passing my chemistry class.
"in fact, physics is not like math, many theories are based on casual discoveries and repeated experiments."
the reason for me being in this class room today is to complete the first assignments on ilearn and to do the first lab assignment.
my major is mechanical engineering.
im in the physics 1 class and physics lab to gather a better understanding of the world around me.
right now im majoring in biology but i havent started my major classes because i dont know if i want to switch or not so it feels like im kind of just wasting time only taking ge classes.
i am terrified of the upcoming exams in physics; i am hoping that coming to this class will help build my confidence and help me to understand how to look at the problems and determine what factors i need to answer the question.
"even though i have to take this class as a requirement, i have always wanted to take take a physics course.physica laws are always referred to in almost every course that i have taken."
i do not like being here because this course does not relate to my major and i'm failing the class.
"after the first lecture, however, i thought this class is the one that it has a lot of connections to our real life and that is helpful to understand how things work in life."
my intentions with this class is to actually learn and pass with an a. i am very dedicated to my studies.
"at first i was very intimidated by sf since i had grown up in the suburbs and had never really experienced living in a city, however i really enjoyed how different things were from irvine."
i enjoy the classroom setting and having open dialogue from petiole of all types of backgrounds and upbringings.
"although it is challenging, i know that it will help shape my mindset and help shape my individualism."
"i also know that physics 2 is a very different breadth of study than physics 1, so i am also interested in expanding my knowledge in physics in general."
i am also here because of my lab ge requirement course.
so now im a bus major with a mech engr minor since i didn't want to throw away all that hard work and also because i love the subject!
"another reason its because you get to be lab coats wear googles like real scientist, and you get to experiment with variables whereas everyone else don't.another reason because i want to be different than my family they all follow different path where they went to business and i want to be the black goat and do something more challenging or interesting to me."
i still don't clearly understand how physics is related to biology and why i have to do the physics lab.
sometimes it can be even be numbing to experience so much in such a short life span but we all have a purpose whether or not we want to accept it is up to us.
just something to get things done sooner.
"i am currently attending astronomy 115 and attending this lab will help me with the further knowledge of astronomy, i have heard form people that this class is fun."
ive taking sci classes for math and i didnt enjoy them at all because they didnt really provide help.
but my teacher ruined it all because he didnt wanna do any labs.
the reason i chose astronomy and am here today is because i simply love the subject and find it fascinating.
i think i should review the lab right after it too because i need to go at a slower pace to fully understand something.
"i did not like physics in high school because it was really hard for me to comprehend it, but now i am actually starting to understand physics and enjoy it."
"well, to start off, im not sure what here really is?"
"i do think practice and experience doing homework even if you fully understand the concepts is beneficial, but i don't spend my time unless forced to like a sci class."
"furthermore, conceptual physics has always been something i enjoyed because it helps frame a sense of grounding to rest upon when thinking about my place in the universe."
"despite being a biology major, i genuinely believe that understanding chemistry concepts will be applicable in my future research work."
i know she'll get to meet my children and maybe even her great grandchildren.
learning all of these ideas and concepts really shows how small we are.
i know i am there because i am choosing to learn and pursue the career i want.
"for example, i can have a better idea of why it is easier to hold the middle part of an object than one side of it."
im also here to learn and better understand certain topics that are taught in class especially the math portions.
"ever since i was a little girl, ive dreamed of becoming a veterinarian."
i think you could interpret this so many different ways.
the fact that we cant see these forces at work adds a bit to the mystery and excitement of this material.
i think i am here for a variety of reasons.
umm to be honest with you i dont how to keep this up for another 150 words.
i am here for several reasons and those reasons can be broken down to more reasons.
"after experiencing those years of watching her suffer, i've developed a love for the medical field and knew i wanted to be apart of changing the lives of others through medicine."
for the past 5 years ive switched through 4 different majors until i knew what i wanted to be.
"but the bigger picture of ""why i'm here"" is that every decision i've made and everything that has happened to me and the people around me in my life has led me to where i am."
another thing is not leave something you can do today for tomorrow.
my hope for the class as a whole is to go forward in life and take advantage of the information; at the very least be able to make a few cool science experiments for my children when that day eventually comes.
"i love working one on one with people, but i also have a hard time with doing the 95 gig."
i am here because i would like additional help in my chem 115 course.
"i do, just going with the flow till i realize what's really going on."
that one worker at starbucks who made your coffee this morning might have a sense for obtaining that job.
i don't know how true that is but i thought it was interesting because if you pay attention to the things that happen around us then you can be really attuned to the things that pop up in your life and why.
"it is still difficult for me to process all the different formulas and calculations but because i have some knowledge about it, i can understand it more clearly.if this class was not a requirement for my major, i don't think i would have taken this course.in a way though, i think that it is good thing that i am taking this course because it challenges me."
so i did the same thing and asked the librarian for a suggestion.
"why am i here? is quite a general question that can be taken in many directions, but i assume that it is intended for us to make our connections to this class."
i ended up choosing bio as my major in hopes of gaining a better understanding of the world around me.
i feel like im here to make the people i love and the people around me live their life to the fullest.
yah i think ima do that...
i think about this a lot.
"as for why i'm here at sfsu, i am here because it seemed like a school with a lot of diversity and opportunities."
i am a dualmajor at san francisco state university.
"i have been greatly inspired by the intellect, positivity, and enthusiasm of the physics teachers i have had, so i think i might continue taking physics courses even though this course is the last physics class required for my major."
i have never taken a sci course before since they often would overlap with my other classes.
i also feel having a good understanding of knowledge and concepts.
"i am taking this class because it is one of the last lower division requirements that i have to meet for my biology major to continue on to more in depth upper division courses .i am also in this class because i decided not to take physics with calculus, even though it probably would have made it easier for me if i did because i already had taken calculus a few semesters ago and got an a in it, so now i had to take general physics two without calculus because i had taken general physics one without calculus."
"no, the second semester i did not have a realistic grip on what my responsibilities were at school, and out of school ( work, money, household chores, friends, girlfriend ) and how to put them all together."
"i am here because i aspire to be a scientist, more specifically an anatomical pathologist that works for the center for disease control."
"when chemistry is involved, physics is almost always involved.i guess another reason why i'm here (pertaining to sfsu) is because it's near my house."
i hope to enjoy this lab course more than previous lab classes as they generally arent my favorite thing.
i came here from texas in order to experience life in a different place and try something new.
literally all the students that are enrolled are in the same boat as me.
i feel like i am meant to be here.
so in a sense i enjoy learning about physics because the underlying thought process shares common ground with programming.
she seems like she actively cares about her students and wants them to succeed.
im here for a college education in order to get a good career that i find an interest in.
i really like that there is a space where we can come for help it means a lot.
i dont know what im doing.
i am here in order to advance in my calc 2 and understand what is happening.
i wish to get good grades out of this class and maintain my gpa. through this lab i also wish to see the cool stuff that happens when we understand physics in our daily lives.
i look forward to learning and understanding physics throughout the semester.
i enjoy the lecture more than the lab because i understand it more.
also why im here is because ever decision i made in my life thats led me to here.
"although this class is only 1 unit, it helps me reach to my requirement."
uhh the tutors are really cool and nice even though i forgot casey name p.s. im sorry casey lol.
i thought that sci 230 would give me more insight and go in depth about topics we just blow through in lecture ( and i was right!).
"moreover, the more deeper i get into this field, the more i understand its importance in the very existence of our society that depends on technology."
"lastly, sci classes are graded based on class attendance and participation, so if you attend every class and do the activities, then you will get an a and earn one unit, which is a good deal."
"finally, he succeeded in launching rockets as the president of a private company."
"school and education plays a big role in this generation, and without education, there isnt much left out there in the real world."
"in addition, this class is also a prerequisite for my major in computer engineering."
"hope for the best for me, please."
the reason i am here is to do experiments and get a better understanding of physics.
im crossing my fingers because kinesiology is an impacted major.
i feel that i am learning as well as teaching people compassion and understanding that everyone has their own challenges and that you cannot compare people.
"3 hours is a very long time to remain focused on one task with no break, atleast for me."
"beyond not knowing what physics is or not having any prior experienceknowledge about physics, i wanted to take this coarse in order to get to know more people."
i am the first one in my family to move out of my hometown so it has been a huge accomplishment being able to do so.
"also, statistics have shown that people with higher education and wealth tend to be healthier."
"im basically just here to get a better grade in the class, hopefully i can pass the class."
other then that i've actually never taken physics in my life before.
it would be such a big help and difference for me when i do pass because i would then realize all of the hard work i have set was worth it.
so far i would say that i like this class and look forward to the upcoming weeks.
i wish we could go outside i really miss going outdoors with my friends and i miss traveling and i spent my 21st birthday indoors.
"his teaching skills helped take an interest in physics, although i am a biology major."
"i feel like science can be applied anywhere while math, english or history etc."
it took me quite awhile to figure out what i wanted to do.
however the hardest thing has been physically being away from campus.
i feel that what i learn in this class will help me in the future because pt is all about analyzing the bodys movements and if there's anything that we can improve on and newtons laws and knowledge of forces will help.
i am taking both a physics121 sci course and chemistry215 sci course.
there's more stress than enjoyment for me.
"phelan glenn vernon wetzell phys11206 8312020 reflective journal 1 : ""why am i here?"" after hearing so much about the struggles of physics i actively avoided having to take this class sequence."
i do not like physics that much but im do enjoy doing experiments.
im in the lab mostly because ive always enjoyed hands on labs.
i signed up for this si class because this is the first physics class ive ever taken.
currently i'm learning conversions which i am bad at.
i definitely learned a lot in my conceptual physic class.
i am in this astronomy class to fulfill a lower division requirement.
but thats not me.
another goal that i have for this class is to gain some confidence within my physics courses so that i am ready to take on my next physics class.
engineering is a field that has interested me and i am excited to learn more about it.
there was an expectation for me to figure out what i am doing and what i am supposed to do.
"also, in taking this class i am preparing myself for my biomechanics class next semester."
these changes that have impacted my life has got me wanting to share it with the people back at home.
"due to the pressure of getting a bad grade, an overload of homework, strict rubrics we have to follow."
there are a lot of reasons why i could be taking this class and i'm glad i'm taking it.
this semester is the first time i am taking a biology course so it would be the perfect opportunity to decide whether i want continue my career in biology or change my major.
but its whatever.
i am in this physics class because i have to be.
the reason i am at college is to better my life and to build my career.
"other than that, i guess id rather do physics than a second semester of calculus."
i really like physics but its difficult to understand.
"for they felt remorse, although didnt understand that it took time for my mother to recover mentally."
astronomy is fun because it has to do with space and i love learning about space.
i am here in the sci class because i would like to be pushed to dedicate time for focusing on physics.
my hopes are to come away from this class with a passing grade and with a better overall understanding of basic physics seeing as this is the first physics class i have taken in my life.
and when i graduate from college i want my background to make a good impression to impress my employer.
"although i'm grateful for the opportunity, i think i could flourish just as much if not more else where."
i am here in this world to make an impact.
the difference is: chinese high school emphasize physical theory much more than physical lab.
"being in this class is very fun because people in this class are very nice, and it is easy to communicate with the teacher."
"coming to sf state was not my top choice, it was actually my last."
"after a couple weeks into the semester, i thought i would give a sci class a try."
another reason i am here because i want to have a solid foundation for calc because i will be continuing onto higher math classes.
"i also like labs because i am a tactile, hands on kind of person."
"many tech companies such as ;apple, google, tesla, settle in this bayarea."
"michael urestiastro 116why am i here honestly i'm not too sure why i'm here but there's only one thing i know and that is to make it worth it all the way through till the end, i personally dont think anyone knows why were all here but i know that everyone has a purpose, goal, desire or a dream they want to achieve in life."
being able to do good in this class gives me the purpose to get my degree and reach my goals.
ideally id want to do both just so i didnt have to choose but ill probably end up having to choose anyway which is stressful.
im here to get a better understanding on cell biology and to practice what i have learned in class into more depth.
i am in sci 111 because i have never taken a physics coarse in my life.
aside from that i have always been fascinated by physics and understanding why things work the way they do.
why i am in this class is because i am major in computer engineering major.
i heard this class is different compared to phys 1.
"and to be fair, i could use the extra boost for my gpa. my instructor quickly lists the main points of the topic and quickly moves to other topics."
"in face, i actually having a hard time to learning other course like biology and chemistry."
now that i'm in this class i can work with other students that are in my lecture classes and try to figure out what some vocabulary might mean or even solving equations together.
i decided to combat climate change by lowering my carbon footprint and finding alternative solutions that wont harm the plant like switching out single use plastics for lifelong alternatives that are recyclable or biodegradable.
"by physics we can figure out some concepts for example, after taking this class we will know how to calculate the vectors, acceleration, force, wight and sound and many other concepts?"
"assuming that, i am mainly taking this class for my major requirements."
"another goal is to study the effects that global warming, ocean acidification, and water pollution has on the marine animals."
i am good at science classes except for physics.
being in a sci class makes it easy to ask questions and work with the people around me so that we have discussions about the concepts comparing to the large 100 people class.
i also enjoy the team work an d bondi ng aspect s of lab because it is a great way to make new friends an d connections.
knowing this the why for me is to speak my truth where i go and to love people where i am at.
i chose to go to this school because i felt it was the best fit school for me since it was far enough away from home but at the same time still close enough to where i can go back and visit often.
"hopefully, i can finish the course excited for the next physics course that is required for my major."
"i started my college career as a political science major because i used to aspire to be a politician, but later decided that was not the path for me."
i think that college is a great place to be as it is a melting pot of people and culture.
"since i have no experience with physics whatsoever, i decided to take sci 111."
"even though my major does not really correlate with this particular course, i still feel that expanding my knowledge in different areas of education is definitely one or the enriching ways to have a full college experience."
science is power!
"i am open to many different specialties and feel like as time goes on, i will find the right fit for me."
i think the calculus is what scares me away from the subject.
"i am excited to be learning physics in a lab setting though, hopefully it serves as a better way to conceptualize the things we are lectured about."
i also want to add that being in this lab allows me to hone my physics comprehension which is a plus.
i am the peace maker.
"obviously capitalist greed infiltrates scientific inquiries the same way it appears in any other field, and im not trying to put the scientists of the world on some noble pedestal."
"at first, i thought that i couldn't be a biology major because i thought i wasn't smart enough because i am not good at math and a lot of my classes involve math."
"physics is also all around us, how things work, gravity, and etc."
keep looking up my friends
"i learned a lot of the same material in my ap biology course(mostly about cancer) and it feels like a good refresher before i go even further, considering my major is biology."
i look forward to working with everyone in class and maybe make some friends along the way as well.
"science is a subject i have always found interesting, but difficult."
"i took the class in high school so i have a bit of background, but this obviously only goes so far since it was so long ago and the topics will be much more difficult here in university."
school is essential in to days society in order to obtain a well paying and generally higher stature job.
it makes me feel more active.
i am here in physics lab because it is part of the requirement as a biology major here at sf state.
"i also feel like, i would benefit from working in a group and having people next to me would really help me understand the concept because they will have a different way of explaining and doing the problem."
i am on the cross country and track team here at state.
these different subjects are all related which makes learning them at the same time easier and also more fun.
i hope by the end of this semester i will gain more ability to understand chemistry because the extra help i will get in science 115.
time went by much faster because i balanced study time in the library with being out and about in the city.
"this company had a program of regularly taking in interns, and i was lucky to be one of those people."
"give reasons as to why this works and this doesn't, what is possible in our universe."
"im not happy with the d grade and think it was unfair th at i got such a bad learning exper ience, so here i am taking phys 101 102 to replace it."
"i think i am here to be a good student and learn, but i also came to my specific ochem ii class knowing that professor anderson is known to be really good at teaching and working with students and so i think i am in this class because i am eager to know more about chemistry and want to learn from a professor who is passionate about teaching and can teach their students effectively."
i felt i mostly had to teach myself how to do everything.
"lastly, i am here because i really want to learn the material much more than i would in lecture alone as we go more into depth and break things down in the sci courses."
excited to absorb new information that has not crossed my sight yet.
this is my first time learning physics or working with these concepts so i need the most help i can get.
i am here because i am required to be here.
i want to be able to show them that i can make it and maybe help them out in the future because theyve helped me so much.
first thought i would say it because this is a requirement that gets me closer to my career goal but diving deeper i'm here because as a junior in high school i found a passion for dentistry.
"and while that may be what i want at the moment, it might change and i hope to find satisfaction with that path."
"im not sure how we are going to do physics labs over zoom, so ill see what the future holds for me."
"due to this, i have a deep respect for the subject even though it doesn't capture my imagination like chemistry does."
"as someone who barely graduated highschool and hadn't taken a math class in 9 years, the thought of going into a field as numericallyintensive as engineering seemed suicidal."
"for a bachelor's in computer engineering, part of your requirement is physics with calculus 1 and physics with calculus 2."
i made them a family.
"i came to san francisco specifically for the beautiful culture, im a psychology major so being exposed to various amounts of different people is going to be beneficial for me in the future."
"also, the functions of the body interested me on how i should take care of it to the best of its ability."
with experimentation we are able to get a more solid feel for how things work than just going off of theory.
"during the spring, i took physics 220, one of the more challenging courses i had taken here, in addition to data structures and a few other courses."
honestly dont even know how long im going to be here it really depends how much effort in time i actually put in all my classes.
i am here because one i never took this in high school so i was new to physics and two i am retaking this class.
"and, i don't see my occupation as my purpose."
why did i choose the stem field?
i was able to find venus with the help of people from the sfsu observatory.
this can then give me an opportunity to take the next step and find my purpose and be successful in life.
i came to san francisco to change the person that i am.
our planet and its health (global warming) impacts us all and we have to better ourselves to keep our planet healthy.
i really enjoyed the discussions and activities the sci class provided and i think i can still benefit from what sci has to offer.
it was unfortunate that my fellow sci classmates also did not understand the material and they had been in the class longer than i have.
why am i here? is a very good question to me because i have been thinking of this question for a long time...
i am excited to keep learning in this academic journey of mine.
i felt comfortable with them and it gave me time to ask specific questions that i had and have something close to a one on one explanation.
"but somehow i regain my courage and my cofidence, so i went to take math again with determination in passing it."
it was that first semester that has been holding my overall gpa over a 2.0 average.
"i always knew that i had a strong passion for inspiring and motivating others to do their best, but i never truly had an idea of what career path i wanted to take."
"i stayed in this class because i notice a difference it has made in my confidence in my calculus homework, lectures, quizzes, and seminars."
ever since i took physics in high school i became very intrigued by the concepts that exist all around us on earth.
i do see that it is important to develop ones mind however.
physics 230232 are both a requirement for me to do so.
"i enrolled in astronomy lab this fall semester because i'm interested in this topic of learning about space like our solar system, moon, stars and more and have a better understanding of the discoveries found in outer space since i don't know so much about it but i'm really excited about learning more about our universe."
"also, i'm a week away from being a certified emt which is exciting!"
"i have started to do everything on my own, pay some of my own bills, cooking, etc,."
people tell me that im still young and that ill figure things out soon but i dont like not knowing whats going to happen in my future.
i dont want to pursue this as my major but i like to learn a little bit about it cus i find it to be mind blowing some of the stuff space can do.
more friends mean more people to study with.
"in highschool i originally wanted to study theatre, but eventually joined a health academy and acquired 400 plus hours towards medical school interning as a student."
"now, she has to work really hard to be able to afford paying rent, and i see her struggles."
it is what humans live to do.
it was a very prestigious and competitive environment that was super toxic for me.
i learn in order to gain more knowledge because thats how you get far in life.
it made us feel so insignificant compared to what endless possibilities are outside our planet.
why it was my choice is because i dont know.
i'm glad to be back and learning again.
i strive for that.
id hate to get into the upper div classes and still genuinely understand what ive learned and have to continuously struggle to piece together everything.
i am also experimenting with the several classes sfsu has to offer until i find what i love.
knowing how these forces are applied and their effects can help a patient.
but i dont know if i'll live up to it.
i hope the same thing happens here in this lab where we are able to work on projects that reflect what we learn.
the reason i am here taking an astronomy lab is because i took an astro lecture class last semester.
"i honestly never thought i would come back to the idea of sfsu after i graduated, but i never thought this world would be in a pandemic anytime soon either, so there's that."
i'm currently majoring in civil engineering and i hope to concentrate in environmental engineering.
but the long term goal is to die.
ive always been interested in learning or taking a physics class.
i look at this class as a new scientific experience in my educational career.
"additionally, terms in physics will appear in future classes or career situations i experience."
i get to learn a bit more on the mechanics of how we measure time relative to us and get a better understanding of how far we are from another celestial body.
"overall, i want to be able to understand biology more."
"so far, in this class i was able to understand in reading stars, constellation, etc."
i am here because i failed two physics classes already at skyline.
"claire (my sister) goes there. after ruling out, other schools i got into, it came down to sjsu and, to my surprise, sfsu. i compared their programs and chose sfsu for their amazing kinesiology program."
taking this class will develop some transferable skills that will help me in the long run.
we the students decide whether to come to class or not.
why are there objects that pull each other while others repeal?
"we not only think about it look pretty, but also wish it can functionally work well too."
"i started narrowing what i enjoy about video games and its the backbone of how it performsfunctions, the engine."
"so i am here facing an old enemy, we'll see how this goes."
"i am sending this assignment late because i am still confusing of the due dates, i am trying to adopt with new learning style."
i truly believe that.
i literally need all of the help that i can get because i really want to pass this class.
taking this physics class would help me get one step closer to being a good candidate for the kinesiology program.
that is the main reason i'm here.
"in order to get to my goal, there are classes i need to take which includes this one."
"learning is not an obligation nor mandatory to do, yet it is the most common thing people do."
"everything is so material and tiny on earth, and we need to remind ourselves we are not the only one."
lab classes as well help give insight into what we were learning and focusing.
"i just added this class and i think it will help me succeed in my bio lecture and lab.the second reason is because i find biology pretty interesting as a subject, and i did well in my last bio class so im hoping this sci course will help me do good in bio 240 as well."
one of the problems i had with my local laundry mat was having trouble keeping coin change as well as broken machines.
at the time i was working as an intern at an orthodontist office and had decided to dedicate my future to it.
i am hoping to specialize in obgyn. i really want to make a difference in women's lives and respect their concerns.
at first i genuinely felt like i am going nowhere because i was not able to go to the school a really wanted to.
there is so much to do here and i can meet new people and make many friends.
i've never been able to utilize most of what i've learned in school in a tangibly productive way.
i am excited for my future goals and excited about learning physics as a whole.
"also, i see sci as an opportunity to meet new people."
the meaning of life?
to me getting an education is really important.
it is amazing review and reflection time on what we just learned in class.
i want to go into a stem field because i think stem is interesting and can lead to real change.
the reason i chose to take phys 112 was mainly because its a requirement to graduate and also because ive never taken a physics class in my whole life so i thought that itd be pretty cool if i did for my first semester of my second year of college.
i guess im just here to fulfill my requirements for my major.
i want to have as much fun before i die and that i am going to do everything i can to remain on that goal.
stem was something i first started in high school as i still didn't know what to do back then.
the engine of the video game is sourced by lines of codes functioning in a complex way that the computer has to understand for the user to access it easier for the general public.
"it was when i first began college that i started to experience the growing pains of a college student in stem. like many students, i got by mostly with lackluster study skills throughout high school, so college was a very rude wake up call for me.i began to really struggle to comprehend math, the same math that came naturally to me before, i started to realize how hard it is for me to study and want to study what was in front of me if i was having even the slightest bit of an inconvenience."
working on lab assignments helps me understand physics better because i have group members that can help me out or vice versa.
"i believe that going to college and taking various classes will allow you to figure out you strengths and weakness and with that, possibly figure out what you want to do in life."
"so why am i here, i don't know yet."
"ironically, i ask myself this question about once a week when i find myself struggling on courses that are required for my major."
honestly the kahoot really put me in bad spirits but also put me in hopes because now i know what i need to learn.
"when the years came by with all these classes, i realized that i like being in this major."
its different because i moved to a different city.
it may be kind of indirect but it is to help them be happy.
"my apprehension towards physics isn't because i find it to be particularly boring or anything negative like that, i simply just find it to be intimidating due to my past experiences."
i am here in this physics course as a requirement for my degree here at san francisco state.
i am here because i chose to be here and i was given the opportunity to be here.
i was not looking forward to this class because i thought it would be quite difficult and i would struggle a lot.
"in physic 111, its mainly lecture therefore, this class is designed for me to visually see how the concepts and definitions are applied to the ""experiment."" not only that, i feel that this class is in a small setting where you can interact with other students to understand their view points of physic."
it gives details on how the concepts in chemistry work and it also explain why the material i studied in precal and calculus is important.
i am here because this is the only path in life that i can see myself taking.
"for me, chemistry is a fairly difficult subject because for the early classes, a lot of it was calculations and math is not my forte."
"but ive jumped back, and im feeling motivated to make the most out of these classes!"
"i have always had a small urge to invent machines for different purposes, like once i wanted to make a snow cone machine that could mix any two flavors into a swirl."
"i am studying in the field of biology, because i have always been interested in science, especially biology."
physics is a basic science aiming at studying the basic laws of material structure and movement in nature.
i love school and i always want to keep learning.
"but regardless, i need the credits to pass and continue my path in college and in life while also gaining new knowledge that would otherwise help in everyday."
"why am i here? i am where i am at currently, being orange county, rather than being in san francisco due to the fact that i am in the middle of a world pandemic and i simply cannot return back to school and continue inperson classes."
"i also find physics super interesting like it is confusing for me, but once i understand it i see why people choose to pursue a career in it."
"i am in the journey of college, and more specifically in the journey of physics."
physics and the knowledge of forces helped me out to design it while taking in consideration many obstacles.
i am not really a fan of physics to be honest.
the physics laboratory helps a student in inventing their strategy towards the subject.
oh that's another reason why i'm interested in this class.
it would be nice if the teacher sold the class set the second day of class to ensure everyone has the materials needed.
"but, besides just having to be here because of my major, i am still choosing to be here."
hopefully by the end of this class i will have a new found knowledge and passion for this subject and be able to see how the universe works in a little more detail.
"i then realized that i care a lot, thats just who i am."
i think that science is one of my main purposes as a human being.
this is important for both my future in terms of improving my quality of life through understanding and my quality of life through having the knowledge to pursue my career.
i wish more people could see that.
i am here because i wanted to get away from home.
i can do physics questions all day in class but it's not nearly as satisfying as doing all the calculations myself and coming up with data to accompany my questions or thoughts.so why am i here?
i thought long and hard about what kind of job i truly take an interest in (women's health) would enjoy going to everyday for the rest of my life and pays well at the same time with the possibility of climbing up to a higher position which would be an ultrasound technician hopefully in an obgyn or neonatal setting.
"i have always had a passion for medicine and throughout grade school, ive always been fascinated in science."
the practice exams are really helpful because they are back check by the two chemistry teachers teaching styletesting style.
"id like to think that i have the answer to that, but the reality is i dont know if i ever will."
"in the past ive had a packed schedule with classes and work, but this semester i allowed myself more room for school by cutting back my work hours."
"basically, i am very interested in finishing my major in order to get a job in computer science, and i am interested in physics."
i am here in sci 240 class because last semester i learned about what sci classes were and i took one for biology 230.
"i'm sitting here thinking that when we will go back to normal and able to go to class at campus, and hang out with friends without bring worried about the virus that is going around."
i am also here because this class is a requirement for me to complete my bs degree in earth sciences.
well according to my major i am supposed to be here.
for instance; invention of generator due to electromagnetic induction; development of chips that are used in computer has drastically changed the world.
sometimes its hard to ask what you dont know how to ask and even harder if you assume its only you thats not understanding the material.
after a couple internships in laboratories i found out just how much i love doing research.
"especially in this day and age, we (as a population) need to be more aware of what we are doing to the earth and all of its inhabitants."
besides that this week i have been trying to focus on finding my routine.
"that being said, i plan to do my best while we are in the middle of a pandemic."
i'd like to think that i am here in my life because of god's plan for me.
ive seen many former mill workers struggling to make it because they lack a degree.
i took sci 115 last semester for my chem 115 and it helped me a lot when it came to making sure that i knew the material that we were learning in the class.
also this helps relieve the stress of physic.
i am here taking this class because one of my friends mentioned it was interesting.
i am looking forward to studying physics in physics 222.
science is the only thing that makes sense to me sometimes.
physics is one of the most difficult subjects i have struggled with in the past.
"like why are we here, and i think that is a question that does require more thought."
and from a very young age i've found so much purpose and happiness in the connecting with and healing of animals and people.
since the lockdown began it was really hard to find many places open or functional.
i want to be able to develop need strategies of ways to help my studying habits that way when it comes to the exam i can be more prepared and well aware of the information than i usually would.
i took a physics course in high school and it wasnt as hard as i thought.
"it would be nice to learn something different, so later it can be helpful in life."
i am actually a chinese and i went to the u.s. when i was 15 years old.
i wanted to move out of the small town that i was living in and discard old habits and beliefs i possessed.
i have to get an a or a b. so this sci 321 class is going to help me a lot!
"if i do not understand a topic, then i would go to this class and ask my questions and get more help until i completely understand what is being taught."
i think its often very important to take a class that is out of your comfort zone because that is when you learn the most.
because it has something to do with mathematics.
"i am more present than before now that i have an internship at ucsf to do medical research, which is amazing because now i can actually apply what i am learning to something meaningful to help others by giving a voice to under represented minorities in and through research. it is really important to have meaningful projects to apply what we are learning because we can help our society in some way."
"im also here because one of my closest friends took this time slot and since we had lab together last semester, i figured it was going to be just as fun."
"i love my family and my life, and i dont regret being where i am at."
"all in all, im here so that i can try my best in school and get through my major!"
this class is just another small step towards that goal.
"i was patient when she was responding slow, for i knew she was experiencing dissociation."
san francisco was the farthest i was willing to go without actually being far.
"without learning this we are unable to build mechanical things like cars, buildings, planes, all the devices that help us improve our daily lives."
the concepts that are taught in physics are harder for me to comprehend than the other science courses.
sydney gonzalezdesantiago feb.
"im not good at chemistry, so i need lots of help and time just to learn something new."
"i intend on living through it all the good, the bad, the ugly, the beautiful."
"i may not understand the material as of now, but once i learn and practice more problems i am sure i will appreciate everything that was taught to me."
i am a kin major so i need this course as a prerequisite for some of my other upper division classes.
however i need to try my best in this class and i make sure to make going to class a priority since listening to the lectures are very important.
"resilience has stuck out to me especially with the way people are approaching this new learning format, especially the professors."
taking this lab made me understand the universe more than the lecture because there are hands on activities that show what a lecture class can't do(because i am more of a visual learner).
"this has raised some interest within me as to how the math is applied differently, not to mention the topics covered in the class in general."
i have failed major courses in the past and i got discouraged and dropped out.
instead i chose to focus on the positives and credit myself for the work i have accomplished today.
"more importantly, i am here because the education system in this university deems that this laboratory portion is necessary in order to put in practice the concepts taught in the lecture portion so it helps us have a more interactive and meaningful experience with the course materials."
who knows maybe one day i will actually go off and create or find a cure for something like diabetes or cancer and i can be the one who was put here on this earth to fulfill something big in life.
"however, i did not get into any of them."
moving from a suburbanfarm town in southern california its crazy to think that i moved away 6 hours away.
"i dont think ive always wanted to go to college, now that i am here i kind of regret it."
i think i'm in this specific class to help with my understanding with physics.
i am here because i am lucky enough to have the opportunity to attend a school in a nice city thats not too far from home.
"i hope that being here, studying hard, going to school, will allow my to someday provide better care for my mother and father as well as others who struggle with mental illness."
"i took physics in high school and absolutely hated it, so hopefully this will be a redemption."
i am here in this lab because it is also required as part of the physics lecture.
i was drawn to it because the job was light and interesting and the patients were always glad to see you because you're changing their future for the better.
"i went into physics pretty confident that i was going to do well, but after the first class my confidence flew down."
"academically, i've always been driven by whatever my passion is."
might be bias because i do love this subject.
"being a visual learner, i cant just listen to people talk and learn from that."
i am here because i need this class as a lower division requirement for computer science.
i just love the area and i still have family near by which is nice.
"in the beginning of my college career, i thought that by working in a healthcare field like pharmacy i would able to work with others directly."
i passed bio 230 with a good grade and i want to do it again for bio 240.
"while im here, i hope to meet new people who i can learn from or share knowledges and experiences with."
i struggle with physics sometimes because most theorems are hard to visualize.
i would like to have not just solving random problems but past exams.i also wonder if we would be allowed to use a cheat sheet andor formulas from the book.
"i am very interested in science, specifically the medical field."
"even though physics isnt particularly my favorite go to subject, i am finding it more and more interesting as we move forward."
so i can say it was all me.
the classes i did take in the summer went very fast and i feel like i retained nothing.
i chose to take this class because this is a class offering help regarding the subjects i am currently enrolled in.
"it also makes sense for me because even though i am an artistic person, my creativeness can be sought else where."
"chemistry is not easy for me at all, i like it, but it has been one of the hardest subjects for me since high school."
another reason why i am here is to set an example for my younger brother and teach him how to be a responsible and hard working person.
"ten years ago, rocket was too expensive to create for a private company so only nasa was making rockets."
hopefully this course will offer extra help.
"if i want to make sure that i deeply understand these basic biology concepts, i need to make an effort to discuss these topics outside of lecture."
i dont know i didn't feel very prepared for the second one maybe because my professor delayed all the material and we got pushed back.
i chose biology as my major because i love working on humans and learning more about human life.
i hope that is the only low score i get.
well i am here because my major requires this course and is the only way i am able to receive my degree.
i am in this course because i am new to physics i never took physics in high school because i was told it can mess up my gpa. hearing that i already knew it would be a challenging course.
that class managed to change the way i thought about science.
"i'm really drawn to math and science because i don't feel like i'm very good at writing or history or anything, so this is a good place i think i can excel in."
the reason why i am here now is because of my mother.
"during the first 2 years at community college, you take a lot of the same general education classes that are offered at any 4 year university as well."
why i am here at sfsu is because i felt like i would get homesick as i live in sf and i didnt want to go to a farther college.
the reason why i choose to enroll in the sci class was because you actually get a unit towards graduation.
by taking this class i am taking care of a pre requisite for medical school.
i need to pass this course in order for me to reach the next class.
i am here because i want a better future myself and for my future generations.
i really hope i passed my chem 215 test.
it breaks my heart to see where the world is going and everyone needs to help stop mass extinction and other terrible factors from happening.
i am hoping sanders comes through in the end.
the reason being of physics is know how the world functions and works.
"with that being said i care for the plant and the beings on them, both animals and humans."
i knew i was going to major in cinema and sfsu seemed like an obvious choice.
i have not taken physics since i was a freshman in high school so i am a bit scared that i will be under prepared for the class but so far i have been able to keep up.
hector flores why am i here?
"the medical field has always interested me, once i got involved with sports and the gym i was more interested in a career that could overlay on those aspects that i enjoy."
"however, i know that 232 is the section where waves, electricity, etc start to come in and that does directly apply to my field and interests of understanding how the machines i build software on work at a more fundamental level."
i used run track until my freshman year of college and with that experience i was able to see pts at work and i fell in love.
i also think that all college stuff gets you prepared for the work load that is waiting for me out there.
i am taking sci 333 because i found out about taking sci classes during my second semester of freshman year during a biology course.
i really have a hard time understanding physics and understanding why its a prerequisite but im eager to learn and my instructor seems very eager to teach so i hope this class is successful at teaching me at least one thing.
"as a matter of fact, while i am required to take this class, i understand why it is important to be a requirement for any type of science major."
i decided i needed to change my major and changed it to general biology.
"she had a very thick accent, which made it very hard to understand her, b ut she was also very unor ganized , writing randomly on the b oard and jumping around with her topics."
"""why am i here"" is a very broad question."
i have always been good with my hands.
"i am worried about my grade in the class because i did not do well in advanced placement physics when i was in high school (i got a b, however the class was weighted so i was worse)."
and if im stuck on any homework questions i can ask my colleagues or assistants in the class for some clarification.
this purpose i believe is not the only one though.
i love space and have grown to love physics as well.
"mhm well, that is a good question..."
"but to answer the question in it's entirety, i'm here taking general physics because it's a prerequisite."
like most students who are in college the big goal of earning a degree is to give themselves the opportunity to advance in society in contributing to what they are researching or studying and to give themselves the chance to get a better paying job.
the next moment i'm being crushed by my mothers uterus.
i am here in this class because it fulfills my major requirements.
"as much as i see myself designing and developing new kinds of robotics (for satellites or fast food restaurants), i don't imagine i'll have to go through the same system of research and documentation as we do in this lab."
we can destroy the whole universe if we are only destroying our own home.
they have provided me with great advice and shared what they have done in the past to get to where they are today.
to make a living for myself.
"being a human, curiosity is something to be grateful for, as i seek out the knowledge of the question or the situation, and i pass it down to the next generation."
"in high school i took chemistry,which i completely regret."
"my first step to getting there is obtaining my undergraduate degree, which requires for me to past this physics 122 course."
"ive taken a physics course before in my juniour year of high school and received a b, but in all honest i have no idea how i got that grade."
every time she would walk up to him at the end of class he would roll his eyes (to be funny) because she always had so many questions.
a huge part to why i am here is because i need this class for my undergrad to be completely honest.
"so, im here to complete school and walk across that stage for the both of us."
solar and lunar eclipses as a result of the moon shadow castes upon earth.
"during my time there, i started to get more involved with the many biology departments which allow me to set up mentorships with the researchers to develop a love for biology because i have an interest in learning how biology works for the creation of all things that are living on the planet."
im looking forward to learn more things that i have forgotten or never learned before.
"we see topics that we learn in class everyday, we always have real world examples."
i have the chance to do the things she did not.
biology and stuff.
i feel just lost sometimes.
my only goal is to graduate on time and get a finepaid job after my graduation.
so i am here in this class.technically i am here because i chose my major.
"for example, how do we have the technology we have now, or the electricity?"
i am at the university to get a quality education so that i can accomplish my goal of becoming a dermatologist and plastic surgeon.
calculus comes pretty quickly to me especially compared to physics.
"at the beginning of my college life, i was firstly majoring in finance because that is what many people majors in."
we are small insignificant size things compared to everything else in the universe.
"when the professor asked us to shout the answer in class, i didnt know the answer nor what to say, so i usually stay silent."
"my belief is that we are all here for each other, whether it may be to love or to hate, we all learn from one another."
i am here in the phys 222 lab because it is an additional requirement for the lecture.
i will be able to do the problems at my own pace and truly understand the steps to get the solution
"seeing the resilience of others motivates me to keep doing what i am doing, and in doing so i learned how important it is to approach any situation with some type of optimism."
it may be helpful as future reference when there might be a situation or problem i may encounter in my life since some of the analysis and theories are relatable to use.
so far i like the lecture class because it has some real world applications.
i am in this class because i need it as a prereq for my major.
i look forward to learning concepts and theories that many scientists revolutionized the world.
"i also originally wanted to transfer to a nursing program, so i applied to many schools in california."
im here because i was to pursue a career that i love which is working with kids.
"lastly, taking a one unit course would boost my gpa so that was another benefit as to why i decided to take this course."
i chose to go into the stem field after many years of lollygagging through college.
"i am pursuing this major because i have had a lot of experience with the healthcare industry, my mom being a nurse and my sister a doctor."
the reason behind me being here is my father went to panama and met my mother.
"ii am here because i find physics very interesting as it affects us on a daily basis and is the reason why we have things that make our lives easier, such as phones, the internet, cars, etc."
truthfully i don't know exactly what i want to do though i am led to believe that a bs in physics can lead to quite a variety of well paying jobs.
the reason why i joined a sci course is to help me understand organic chemistry ii and to learn beyond what is taught in the short hour of lecture.
"when i graduated middle school in china, my parents decided send me to the united state to finish my high school and university study."
when people made comments while looking at the night sky.
also doubting if i'm good enough or smart enough to excel at all these things at once.
and this particular lab section was the only one that fin in my schedule.
i am here because i chose to be here.
"i am taking this class, and every other class, to expand my mind and gather the mental tools to make sense of the world around me in a rational way."
"so basically, i am really excited for my college journey."
i am here taking this class simply because it is required for my computer science major.
i am not from san francisco so i thought it would be interesting to attend a schoolout of the city that i live in.
"we find the laws from the chaos of nature, use the laws, and then explain all phenomena of nature."
i need it to be successful in this class to be able to go on with my major.
"though i had little options, i chose sfsu because of the rich culture and the countless opportunities its surrounded by."
"im here because i after 8 years of working towards a music career, i decided i didnt want a career in music."
i wonder if my choice to take physics was a right one.
"by enrolling in physics lab, im learning to apply lecture concepts onto real world applications."
"so i'll do my best to come on time and be present for whatever activity youll have instore for the class and i'll bring my willingness to learn, a good attitude, and hopeful enough knowledge and understanding on a topic to help someone else who might need assistance."
i want to be able to provide for my family and especially to give back to my parents.
"this class is a requirement for my biology major, but i am actually very excited to learn about physics and how it applies to the real world and myself."
"at the end of the day, i still hope to leave thisclass with some helpful information."
"i am here in san francisco because when it came time to pick a school, i wanted to get as far as possible from home."
i have a little background related to engineering based on my last job as a student assistant technician at my colleges engineering department and my experience wrenching cars.
it all honesty i dont really want to take physics but its an interesting class nonetheless.
"not only that but i also wanted to learn about the sun and moon and by taking this course, it is allowing me to do so."
"it also gives you an opportunity to ask any questions that you have, that you were unable to ask in class due to time."
but i am somewhat interested in physics because it also helps me with my readings.
i also wanted to take other concepts classes and the math concepts was my last choice.
"what those transitions are, is up to the universe to decide."
week 3 reflection: why am i here?
honestly i can rant about any of the above choices that i mentioned but i think your question relates to either why am i taking this supplementary course or why im at this school.
i am here because i am a biology major and this class is one of the prerequisites for my major.
"so with the personal pressures and college pressures mixed together, i found myself swamped and less motivated to get through the school year."
i also live very close by so it was convenient to come to this university.
my goal is to work hard and grasp an understanding of the topics taught so that i have a good foundation for when i take the next physics course needed.
"hard work that will require a lot of energy, such as sleepless nights and lots of studying."
im here to practice my skills and learn how to share my ideas in a group setting.
it is good for me to know about physics and other sciences to help me in my path to my future career.
"to be more specific it is biochemistry, which will require me to take other future courses for my major and i want to have a stable ground which i can stand on and build off of its foundation."
i personally dont like learning about the more mechanical processes like gravity and stuff.
if i don't pass another class i wont be allowed to continue.
one reason was to fulfill the requirements for my regular astronomy class?
i have already taken general chemistry and organic chemistry i and ii. i really enjoyed these classes and found them to be challenging.
"obviously, college isn't meant for everyone."
i feel as though its important and overall something i wouldn't mind being at.
im always scared to ask questions in lecture because of how many people are in there.
not only that he made physics class fun to be in with projects and demonstrations in class.
"i feel like being able to see it through labs, it would make a lot more sense to me instead of just seeing physics as a bunch of math equations."
she was able to give me everything i needed to in order to continue on my journey.
im taking this class because it is one of my prerequisites.
"even if most of the things we do in the lab hardly have real world applications, it helps up to build up the skills needed to apply rational thought to real life situations."
i will be rst generation university graduate.
why am i here i want to talk about why i came to united state that will explain why im here.
when i was a junior in high school i attended an occupational school for where i learned digital media.
so this class seemed like the best way to balance that.
the reason why im currently here at this school consists of different reasons.
but i feel like there's so much more out there that i haven't been able to take advantage of.
this is the reason why i am here.
"i really thought that a sci class wasn't really worth my time, but it actually is."
"when i think about things that have changed human lives and made standards of living go up, i think of inventors and scientists."
i am very interested in the stem field.
i hope learning physics can help me to do better in stats because i am a statistics major and i believe physics is related to any kind of source that we are exposed to.
"but i think the main important reason as to why i am here is to not only make the troubles and contributions that were done for my sake to not be wasted, but to really find out if the path that im set on now is my purpose."
it was such a struggle for me to realize who i was and where i wanted to be.
i realized at that point that we were selling our jobs to the computers.
"honestly, im not really sure what a definitive answer would be to most of those questions."
"so, i asked the librarian what i should read."
i am here taking this si class because i'm afraid of not passing my physics class.
i am here because this is the only lab class that would fit into my schedule and is not on a friday.
it feels odd now being in a sci class after having taught them for over the past year.
"although concepts in physics sometimes confuse me, i hope that doing lab activities will help me understand them better by seeing everything work right in front of me."
"after all, there is a reason why human connection is incredibly important to our health."
"during the process of discuss, analyze and conclude, i have more sense of how other classmate think, and what i need to improve."
"a few years have gone by, but as we advanced in our class my memory is beginning to remember some formulas, i remember i loved geometry..."
"if this question is pertaining to the astronomy lab, i am here to fulfill the ge requirement from san francisco state."
also since my homework is due on tuesdays i am able to clear up some confusion that i had over the weekend and can revise questions on my homework that i didnt understand at first.
in the grand scheme of things we're tiny insignificant particles in this potential multiverse...
"i look forward to this class and lab because after the first day i can tell that this will be a better time around than the last physics class i had, both my teachers were somewhat robotic and did not have fun."
i can talk about why i am here at this current moment or why i am here on earth.
i am here for two reasons: 1.
"i only took one physics course in middle school and i had to make a car that would move with a balloon, but i dont remember if it actually worked or not."
everything is convenient.
i also like engineering because my father is civil enginner back home.
"i took physics in high school and found it pretty interesting, but hard i really enjoyed working on the labs with my friends."
hopefully i can learn things in this class that i can use to help be in both my major and my field.
i had to answer the same prompt for cell bio and i basically have the same answer.
i enjoy everything about computers from building them to programming them.
i also think that the things i learn in these classes might come in handy later on in my job field.
this is my first experience having a lab dedicate to physics so i'm curious but a bit nervous at the same time.
honestly though i think physics is really cool.
the reason behind that is physics is very applicable and available compared to another branch of science.
"giving the circumstances, i don't think i will be able to move up any time soon."
"i've always loved space and cosmic objects, so when it came down to choosing a science to take, i knew i wanted to take astronomy."
"my approach to medicine is a holistic approach which i believe is the best approach because it doesnt solely focus on prescribing medication and sending people on their ways, rather it focuses on pushing health and taking care of the person as a whole in order to ensure that i left them better then when they came to me rather than just temporarily fixing one problem while inducing another one."
i noticed that we are all different people and we can offer different type of knowledge to each other.
im also here because i fulfilled the prerequisites for this course by completing precalculus last semester.
i learn better via a handson approach so taking this class has helped me a lot.
"online learning is a sad new reality for students, at least in the united states."
i also want to learn more about physics because the subject really interest me.
"between stressing about classes, money for rent, and trying to looking for a job i think i'm holding on."
a lab is required to be taken concurrently with this physics class.
after scrambling for classes i realized that physics 111 and 112 also qualified for my major.
my ultimate goal is to become a marine biologist and eventually get a doctorates degree.
there are many different potential jobs to do.
i am a business administration major and i am not required to take physics.
gerardo nunezwhy am i here?
"i hope that i can easily understand what happens in life through this course, and have the ability to make correct judgments when facing problems."
so far in my college career i have managed to get okay grades but still succeed when i am not doing so well in a class.
david botello 090120 reflective journal the main reason why i am taking this physics course is because it is one of my prerequisites and requirements for my major.
so far in the first lab we underwent electromagnetism and charges.
"the ingenuity of humans and the learning ability and speed of computers will change the world as we know it, and i want to be at the forefront."
this class has been a great way for me to start of the semester.
the bigger reason is that this class was one that fit well into my schedule.
i love everything about this school and just wish it didnt have to be online.
i find it super helpful that sfsu provides resources for students to have extra practice and aid to solidify knowledge of certain classes .
i also hope this class will help me understand physics more by just practicing more problems.
i think learning the basics of how the world works around us is very important.
"after a couple years of doing this, my general interest in topics began to differentiate."
"i guess i can say that i've found my own purpose, as cheesy as that sounds."
my parents are in la so its not that far where i can't go visit at all so i thought this was a good school where i was able to be independent but still visit my family every once in a while.
many things we have today would have been invented without the knowledge that comes from learning physics and how it affects us.
i want to get into research.
"i want to learn, so i am here to get supplemental help."
"not to mention, it can also fulfill my general education class requirements for college, then i can move on to upper division classes."
this is really a philosophical question you're asking here.
"we all have our personal issues outside of school that affect our performance, such as anxiety and depression for me."
i hope to pass physics this semester but most importantly i hope to understand the concepts i am learning.
i know biology is largely based on building one concept off of another so by taking sci 230 it will help me make sure that the foundation of everything were learning is not lost on me.
"also, i'm interested in how the stuff works around us in our daily life."
i don't want to hate a subject because i'm too slow of a learner.
i did very well in physics 220 but physics in general gives me anxiety.
honestly i don't know what i am actually doing.
jessica e. guizar09032020why am i here?
i find this ok but also not very effective to my understandment.
i personally like physics myself so attending this lab is fun to me.
why am i here?i am here because my mom did not know how to use birth control and my dad did not know how to use a condom.
"i'd have to say that sci would have benefited me if i took it for bio 240 as it would have given me a time to where i'd be motivated to study, memorize, and do the content i have been learning in class."
physics can be used in several different ways when it comes to marine biology.
"science has always been something that ive had a great interest in, which is why im currently a biology major."
i didnt know which i wanted to be either an engineer or a nurse.
i come from an abusive family.
i took chem 100 and i got a c. i know that i could have done better if i would have had the extra help.
im not that interested in physics but so far from being in this class physics does not seem to be too hard but also not easy.
"this class is a prerequisite to my major but also, i never took a physics class so i wanted to see if physics is a really interesting subject in the science field."
"i enjoying being in class when i actually understand the material, however, when i do not understand a topic, the class becomes quite frustrating."
"i've had to overcome a lot of adversity to make it to this point, and i am so grateful to be in a place that i spent so many years dreaming of."
"in medical school, i will need to understand the human body and how each part works and why it works."
"i need to be someone, not someone famous perhaps, but someone who can look into a mirror and recognise who is on the other side."
i feel that i am ahead of the game because i know what this course holds however i will go above and beyond to finish this summer semester strong.
it seems cool and i am glad to be a part of it.
i was a neuroscience minor because i loved understanding how the brain works.
i feel like the reason why im in this class has to do with the reason why im here in general.
"this way by being in this class, i know i am taking the necessary steps to set myself up for success and not failure."
it's a big beautiful world and universe.
"i am also taking this course at the same time as another lab course which could be a good thing because they may go somewhat handandhand, but i am hoping the overlap does not get too confusing."
"i am in physics 101102 to learn about physics, and how the natural world around me works."
i'm afraid of asking for help.
"since physics is all about problem solving, i hope to get problemsolving skills from this class."
we read about many basic physics stuffs which can be used in our daily lives.
"at least not that i've seen.part of the answer has some basis in how i came to be on this earth, i think."
"i am in physics not only because it is required for my major, but for me to better understand how things work on the world."
i partially describe myself as a scholar and i feel the most scholastic taking part in the scientific activities.
"although im not taking this class voluntarily, i understand the importance of this lab. my major is computer science."
"i am here in this class because i am a biology major with a concentration in physiology and the requirements for my major is to take this class with physics 111, and to be eligible to get my bachelors degree."
i suppose the second reason why im here is just for the extra support im case if i need it since there are some hard classes so it wouldn't hurt to just take them.
it is so interesting how much makes up our entire universe and how much we dont know about yet.
"however, because phys 112 is mandatory with phys 111, here i am."
"rosalyn prem february 24th, 2020alma journal 1question: ""why am i here?"" i am here as a biomajor because i believe that just like anyone of us in this classroom, we are all able to become scientists."
but why am i here more specifically in school.
i was given the chance to think freely and to create actions that can affect those around me and change things in my life.
"at the same time, physics makes sense because i can physically see everything that we discuss like gravity and acceleration whereas in chemistry, i just have to trust that electrons actually exist and interact in the way that im told they do."
i need help in understanding how i can improve myself to be better for a specific problem i have during lectures in chemistry 115.
physics will help me if i ever need to make any calculations that involve movement along any of the three axes.
that is the reason why i am in this class.
"one of the skills to learn, i believe, is to connect with something that you already know or something that you can think of."
i also feel that there is no such thing as learning enough so i know that there is always something new i can learn here whether its a harder problem or just going more into details with definitions of topics.
"i have a strong image of how i want my life to turn out, and being here will help me paint my canvas."
"i am not saying it is a wrong belief to have, this area of intelligence and it's true value are impossible to record by mankind which is saying something in itself."
"it's either i will choose a career path in this college path, or realize i have a better path else where and pursue that instead."
for that reason it is that i felt the need to instead take advantage of my time.
then i began to focus on math and science from a young age.
i am extremely grateful that i have an education because not many have this opportunity.
"i've always wanted to help animals ever since i was a little girl, specifically dogs, because i love them so much."
i would love to become a doctor in the future and do surgery or become a pediatrician.
i guess fate.
either for ourself or someone very important to them.
it is the curiosity in humans that drives us to be smarter and innovative.
physics will be very helpful in reallife situations that i may come across in the medical field.
i am too young.
i just finished my undergraduate courses and now taking that classes that the program is looking for.
"i feel like it is kind of hard to describe the full reason as to why i want to go into stem field, because there are so many reasons."
"i personally have never really liked physics, probably because it is more math than a lot of my of my other science courses on top of the fact that it is (in my opinion) a more abstractdifficult course."
i am in computer science because originally i wanted to join the military but then trump got elected so i went to college and choose my major by throwing a dart at a board.
"after the first exam, only 6 of the class passed with a grade of d or higher."
"although i could have attended other schools, this school was more convenient."
i feel like knowing all this information can be beneficial to the real world and my future career in medicine.
"the majority of classes are lecture based, which involve sitting still for at least an hour to listen to theories and problems."
the number one.
"personally, when i decided to add this class, it was because i thought o chem 2 was difficult."
i'm currently taking two classes and a lab for my first semester because i have a fulltime job.
"i'm here to learn more about general physics and get a better understanding of how the complex concepts discussed in the lectures in my other class, actually function in real life."
i also need a fooking hair cut rn.
"it's also quite ironic because i'm in an engineering related field so it's quite funny to think about an engineer who isn't particularly good at science or math, which are the two tenets of any engineering background. thanks for listening to my ted x talk yup.i'm also here because of decisions made by my ancestors and myself to survive so far.in case you don't understand english, i've translated this into latin so you can better understand.bonum quaestio!"
"hopefully, i finish in 2 years and being here right now in this class adds up to that point."
it was all done based off my curiosity as mentioned before.
i am here so that i am can become confident in speaking up and sharing my thoughts in an organized structure.
i thought i wouldnt be capable of learning this subject but i passed physics 1 and i believe if i study hard enough i can pass physics 2.
"i have taken physics before and i did struggle, especially with word problems."
i come to this class not as a past failure but as someone with experience and understanding of what to expect.
we go recap on a lot of material so i can really get what i going on by all the example problems they give us and seeing why and how to work together to really understand the material rather than just knowing the information from a short class period.
"however, similarly if you asked a dog to recite a poem in english you would come to the same conclusion it would."
i learned how to manipulate the equations that will help me in physics.
"for example driving a car, opening a door, and even walking.its good to understand how the little things in our life function."
"this question got me contemplating tho, like why am i here?"
"in terms of concepts and theories from physics, i don't know much about physics."
i also took an astronomy class last year and i enjoyed taking that class.
"because of breakthroughs in the past we have eliminated lots of diseases like smallpox and polio, diseases that have decimated millions in the past can now be eliminated with a shot."
"why am i here, i am here for a few reasons."
im here in this class because im taking a physics lecture class and this is a course we take along with the other.
"from my results last semester, i received all as which felt amazing since the rest of my college career was abysmal based on the transcripts."
i did not want to take any chances with physics so i made the decision to receive extra help.
"""why am i here?""i am here because this class is a necessary step in the degree and ultimately career path that i want."
the list keeps going!
i dont even have my passport yet.
i am here because i choose to be the better person rather than staying at home and being a useless member of society.
"however, it's not too bad i've always excelled in science and math, but due to my poor work ethics, the damage is evident in my past grades."
computer science is about logic and how things work.
being in this class i will maybe meet new people that have different kinds of majors.
i'm also trying to see some interesting things by doing some experiments.
it also shows academicmental flexibility as physics is not related to the profession i am pursuing.
i have a hard time finding out which formula could be used to solve the problem and i am just really bad at math in general.
"the tools necessary in determining why i am here can only be answered in asking who caused me to be here, then, who caused my parents to be here, and so forth and so on."
i also get to ask any of the questions i might have about the lectures we have gone through.
"i am not the biggest fan of labs, because i am not very good with my hands at all, but i am required to take a lab along with physics 230."
"while i might not need to specifically known translation and transcription or anything like that for my specific career goals, it'll give me the background i need to be good at my job."
i had zero confidence in myself to be where i am and never thought i would be in college.
in high school i had to an option to take physics but i never taken it because i did not like math.
"it would have probably helped me get a better grade in the lecture class to take them together, but it wasnt as bad as i thought to just take the lab which also serves as a refresher for my next semester taking physics 121 and physics 122."
but to be honest in the back of my mind i know what it has taken me to get to this point.
i feel like i have to have this big purpose in my life already figured out.
i personally do not like labs which i thought was because of the length but i find that i usually go into lab very confused with the instructions and not really understanding why im recording measurements.
"in terms of this class, i would say i needed the extra unit to complete this ge requirement and so im here in this class now."
"i love the creativity and mathematics filled environment where i have a blast playing around with graphs, equations etc."
"furthermore, the main reason why im taking this course is due to my major."
"i have taken physics before during my junior year of high school, but if im being honest, it wasnt exactly the best."
"physics applies to many aspects of life, however, so that helps somewhat in terms of having motivation to put in effort."
i am here because i need help with subject and i dont understand how this class works.
"it started as one of those careers that elementary school kids talk about when their teacher asks them what they want to be in the future, and my answer was always a brain surgeon, because how awesome does that sound."
getting declined from uc davis because they have a great vet program lead me over here where i can get my degree then try uc davis later.
"whatever the purpose may be, if any, i know why i'm at san francisco state university, taking physics 112."
"i'm hoping to have a good foundation of psychology before working with children because i believe it is important for them to learn about mental health, and not be invalidated by others when it could be more than ""teen angst"" or any other excuse."
why am i in college.
being in physics is difficult for me because there are many formulas i need to memorize.
i also hope to become good friends with my lab partners since we are not able to see each other in person.
"that, is how i want people to remember me by...."
"when switching from a nursing major to a microbiology major, i find myself needed to take a physic course."
i would feel more comfortable redoing the sequence rather than just being confused in the next class.
i know physics plays a role in kinesiology since it used in biomechanics.
i think about what i can do to be better and about the priveledge i have.
"i need to be able to remember, comprehend, and manipulate various formulas."
and it was the same reason i am now taking an astronomy lab class.
"i do like physics, though."
college so far has truly been a very life changing experience for me.
i now understand how particular this class is to understand and develop my academic career and research career.
a lot of the people i've talked to dreaded taking physics but so far i've really enjoyed my time in the class.
its easy to take the simple fact that i am able to do what i want for granted.
"in my opinion, if i wanted to really understand and want to learn physics i wouldnt be taking a physics course in this day and age."
i really do hope to get a lot out of this class despite the circumstances.
according to who?
my second year at state was when i took advantage of these sci courses because i knew that they would help succeed.
"since i was a kid, i've always been curious about many things especially the body."
"but most scientists are in their fields not for money or selfish reasons, but because they have a pure interest in their subjects and they want to learn as much as they can, and share that knowledge with others."
i am also hoping that the class will be useful.
i like helping people and making people feel great about themselves.
i took one year of physics during my junior year of high school.
"gradually, i passed some classes and got into a specific academic route and this is the point that i am at."
n. velez im quite literally here in this class because i took physic s before but didnt pass with a grade i wante d.
"i have learned so much about myself during my time at sfsu, but i can honestly say that i am prepared and excited for what is to come for me and my future."
i am here to better my life and prepare for the future.
in terms of this class i am only really here for my major.
one of my goals will be to live in san francisco for a year and learn as much as i can from this city.
i also heard that physics 2 is a lot more conceptual so im a bit moreat ease.
"it definitely is a difficult journey and comes with many challenges, but in the end, i will achieve something that is going to benefit me for the rest of my life."
this class is one of my most challenging courses there is for me as a student.
"i still enjoy life, but i enjoy it walking forward towards any goal i put myself to."
"i feel like the physics is at the center of life whatever we do, whether if its driving, walking or even when i am writing this essay."
i like to relate what i learn to everyday activities because it is easier to remember and understand.i have only taken one physics class besides this one and so far its a good time.
"i hope to learn a lot about marketing, and have my own business one day."
my grandpa passed away when i was in high school so i really wanted to still have a reason to come to san francisco.
why am i here on earth?
this is very important to me.
"second on my list is italy, once i get my hands on pasta from italy i can die a happy woman."
"if that is the path i eventually do not take, i am very interested in virology and would like to study them."
i tend to have a hard time with math as well so i believe that may add on to the difficulties that i will face in this course.
so i can spend my junior and senior year trying internships and exploring new places.
"with that said i've always been a fan of math and science, the idea of why things happen in the real world have crossed my mind but i've never really understood enough to explain what i see."
i ask myself what am i doing to create a better future for myself but not forgetting to live life in the moment.
"i am here to be happy, to make an impact, and to make a change during my life span."
science is my weakest subject.
i wonder if i will enjoy the online lab experience better than in class.
it takes a lot of hard work.
i care about my grades and i really enjoy the topics although its difficult.
"office hours seem scary to me sometimes, because i don't know what questions to ask."
so i am taking this class and planning on learning the material well so that i will be able to use it in the future.
i am hoping that this time around i can do better than i have in the past.
"the real question isn't in the metaphysical sense (what i have been describing above), which is the deep question to why i am here."
"i know in the real world, math is used again time after time after you graduate."
when enrolling in classes for the spring semester i knew exactly what i needed to take but i didnt consider the amount of credits that i was taking.
my brother and i used to watch how its made for hours on saturdays and sundays.
as the knowledge i learn in this class will completely determine how well i do in the next physics course.
i do enjoy physics and i believe that everyone should have a basic understanding of it.
i have been worried to take this class as physics is always regarded as one the harder subjects you can take.
"i don't have any low expectations for this course, and i hope that the lab supplement can help me understand the lectures even more, despite the onceaweek meet time."
they got married and eventually moved back to the united states.
as a firstgeneration college student it was really hard for me to get here.
"personally, i do not like to take any physics class in high school and in college because i don't like math and i am just bad at it."
i am here because i am advancing in my academic goal of getting my bachelors in biology with a concentration in physiology.
i pay my own tuition and its way cheaper compared to private colleges or out of state colleges too.
i changed my major to biochem and of course one of the pre requisites is physics.
"i somehow still passed the class with a d even aft er i didnt show up for th e last three week s of class or the final , which tells me the school threw a massive curve for the students ."
honestly i am really excited for my physics courses this year much more than any of my other classes.
the physics lab specifically is showing me isolated scenarios and allowing me to analyze them so that i can fully understand them when i come across them in real life.
i hope that this lab will help me understand what is happening in the lectures.
"i consider myself a lifelong learner, as i am constantly curious about the world around me and how everything works together."
for months i worked random jobs while i searched for something to inspire me.
it is my goal to help with what i have learned in pakistan.
i do like some math stuff but i have a hard time understanding physics the way it is taught.
"i have also been passionate about these two things since i was about two, mostly animals."
physics is very useful and that is probably the only thing that makes it interesting to learn it.
i have also been looking for science clubs to join in order to meet other people from my major.
i think i will be a more competent and knowledgeable biologist with a solid understanding of physics.
i am a pre nursing major and chem 115 isn't exactly for pre nursing majors but i still took the class because it's a challenge and i thought it would help the concepts of dilutions and the equations and everything.
i could say i am here because of the simple fact that my mother gave birth to me.
"i chose sf state because i grew up and went to school in a small town, and i love sf and being in a city."
i have taken a sci class before and the first couple of ones didnt work out so well but the latest one i took was great so im here to try it again.
despite the horrible date learning what he did intrigued me.
these people would use science to create incredible visuals and more to reach another level of the artform.
maybe one day i can work for elon musk for spacex but if not nasa would be dope.
"education is not a luxury but a need, an educated person is more accountable than one that has not to have as much education."
as years pass i tried to figure out a career path i want to follow and be successful financially as well enjoying it too.
which im majoring in just because its a job i know i can do well in and tolerate as a career.
"the question, ""why am i here?"" is a pretty deep question."
"as for other reasons, i have always been intrigued by the world of physics and their law and theories."
"of course, i have thought of the downside of being a veterinarian as well."
i hope my attendance will help with understanding the material and being able to correctly calculate the various problems.
"while some of the material may be review, i am excited to learn new things and refresh my memory."
my first impressions of the lab are ok i guess.
i am taking this sci class because i need help to get through physics.
i always feel like when im asked why im here i think there is a lot of pressure for me to answer that question a certain way.
"""why am i here?""why am i here?"
an event that set this goal into action was my mother attempting to attempt suicide by over dosing on painkillers.
i know that i was put on this earth to bedo something great.
i feel that personally this class is not entirely necessary for computer science majors to take.
i just enjoy the certainty that it brings.
"i am here for an abundance of reasons, but again, it is mostly for myself."
even though physics is a hard subject for me to learn i am willing to put in the effort in understanding it
"since then, ive enjoyed learning the different facets of engineering and the technical pieces that follow."
i feel like the reason i am on this planet is to try to impact the others around me in a positive way and to leave this world in a better condition that it already is.
"while the subject is very interesting, i do not have a passion for science at all."
that is why i ask myself this question.
i sometimes struggling to not use my calculator because i have always used it in my pervious classes.
the reason i study lies in the constant fear of failure i acknowledge in myself.
"i tend to enjoy helping other people learn chemistry and also enriching what they do know, so i may end up being an educator because of how i love to learn about chemistry and help people."
"in understanding animals for biology, physics can help us understand how they move and the factors that affect it, such as weight and gravity."
over time i actually didn't know if i would end up here but i love to be here.
"when i have done these things, i know that i will be content with the life that i lived."
the initial reason i took this course was because i needed a one unit course to be considered a full time student.
do we just die off like stars do?
"my first year here was stressful, for being given heavy loads of homework each day."
i am a dental assistant and have been working as one for 15 years.
"even though i struggled throughout school, i was able to make it through even if it doesn't go my way."
i am here because sf state is close to hometown in san jose.
i have mentioned in the previous class i haven't been the biggest fan of physics.
electrical currents have always intrigued me on its reliability and complex simplicity.
so i think it is also a good way to help me understand how things work.
physics can help provide deeper levels of a subject and can be beneficial in daily life scenarios which can improve your problem solving skills.
"when someone asks me why am i here i think about the present moment, i am honestly in this class because its a prerequisite for my major."
"particularly, i am in its class because it is a prerequisite for medical school."
a degree will let me have more options in the future.
"i hope that by the end of this semester, i will be able to absorbs most of the knowledge from the labs and lectures and the apply those knowledge in real life scenarios."
we are here for a purpose and to live with the earth and not to take the earth for profit.
"i also want to find happiness, which i know is never a constant but that will only make me appreciate it more when i am happy with myself and my life."
i am in this class because i need extra help studying for bio 230.
i am here because i have changed what i wanted to study at school about 4 times without being certain whether i would like it or not.
emily pham 091020 physics 102 reflection i am here because i wish to learn more about how the world works in a way.
in order to apply to grad school i need ochem as a remaining prerequisite.
"i was scared to take a step into a more advanced course in my senior year because i knew physics could get really complicated, but i had a really good teacher who really cared about his students."
"i guess that the college experience, but i have made it this long, these past three years have been a quite a challenging journey, adjusting my school schedule with work is still a hassle."
"when i was in high school, i wanted to become an astronomer but i ended up coming to college for child development."
"then i wondered why i chose this major over others, and realized because i love machinery."
they are my reason to go on in life.
"if it were not for my major, i would not take this course since physics has always been the course that i try to avoid."
im not interested in the math aspect but when we talk about the stars and galaxies i find myself more into the conversation rather than a conversation that determines the longitude and latitude of where a stick figure person might be.
"i don't know why i'm here, in this universe, but i know that every event in my life thus far has let me to this moment of questioning my existence."
we all have some purpose.
i am here because i am taking linear systems analysis as a requirement for my major which is mechanical engineering.
i also want to learn how things work around me and why they do certain things like a balling falling straight down due to gravity pulling it inwards.
i told how i really liked the books about rocks and how i already read all of them.
"i have taken 3 chemistry courses in community college, and have not been successful all three times."
"i am also not terrible at doing math and thinking logically, so this career choice seemed like a nobrainer."
i am here because i should be.
"17, 2020why am i here as in this class, in this college, in this part of california or in the broadest statement of all, why am i here on earth?"
"if i didnt take summer classes to get ahead, again, i would never be in this class."
"i play the piano regularly and practice jazz piano, and when i took that class i was also well ahead of the curve."
i am now taking this class for my learning as well as for my major and i hope to do well in them.
although i haven't had many pets myself i have always loved animals growing up.
i am looking forward to see what else i can learn from this class from here on out.
my main goal in college is to be successful in whatever it is that i decide to do because it is only my first year and who knows where life will take me.
here we can compare notes or go over topics that we may have not gone over yet.
i have loved fashion my whole life and believe it was my purpose and lifelong dream to be in the industry working alongside big name designers and stylists.
"moreover, i am also here to understand and gain new knowledge about physics, as well as learn from others and increase the understanding of what i am doing with my life."
"the most interesting stuff to learn in physics, i would say i like to learn gravity and movement."
i know for a fact that i am not very skillful at doing mathematics or anything quantitative.
stem majors are pretty hard but as long as i study enough the classes shouldnt be too difficult to learn and i can be a good handy man knowing about how all things that surround us are made.
"i don't really like going to tutors mainly because they have a different teaching style from other teachers and they usually confuse me more with a complex subject like math, but i need more time with the material and this is the next best thing, so ....."
working my issues out here will be my main support aside from homework.
"i'm at sfsu on the other hand because it suits me the most considering my financial, social, and academic standing and preferences."
"if everyone waited for the answer to be given to them, then humans would never advance beyond the stone age."
"throughout my educational career, i have been pretty successful in passing all of my courses."
i had taken a sci class in the past and had found it immensely helpful.
i am a kinesiology major so i am here to learn to help others.
"i grew up in the east bay, and i always wanted to live in san francisco because of all the opportunities."
"instead, i'll draw something up with cad and write descriptions based on what it does and why it does it."
i am a big fan of math but for some reason physics doesnt stick to my brain.
im not shy to say it how it is and it will drive me to success.
learning about the world in a lecture can be really boring at times even if you are interested in the subject.
"although i do not qualify for fafsa, my family and i still can not afford for me to live on campus or in san francisco."
it will be very helpful to me since i have much to learn in physics.
"as i got older, i started to realize the complexities of the machine and all the different aspects of the industry which only made me more fascinated."
part of me wishes this wasnt the case because my major is all about the study of animals and apart from the physics of their molecules in the bodies of the animals and apart from that physics has no correlation.
i am passionate about my end goal with my degree but i do not think i am specifically passionate about physics.
"it's a selfish wish, which is why i continue to live for others, to nurture them and attend to their needs."
"i love science, so i'm excited for this class."
i am currently enrolled in sci 240 section because of my current and future career aspirations.
"i am here in san francisco because at the time of applying for college, i thought i wanted to move away from home and experience a new city."
"i like physics, and my major, but let's go way back."
its the only hpyscis class required for my major and i assume its because of kinetics and deriatives.
i wanted to give up when i failed a second time.
i am able to teach myself or learn from other people and i don't necessarily need a degree for that.
"specifically speakers, im here today in this sci class because i need help with calculating valence electrons,atomic orbitals, and electron configuration."
"like how to determine the dimensions of an area in order to build some type of shelter or find out how much material i will need to put up some sort of fencing, or figure out how deep something is in a body of water."
it was not until college that i learned the applicability of a good education.
honestly i would have absolutely no clue about central dogma and cell division if it wasnt for this class.
this weekend i plan to start reading the book and taking down notes .
"chemistry can be fun and exciting if it's understood, however can be easily frustrating and difficult if you get lost along the way."
i really enjoy the energetic vibe of the class and how open everyone is as well.
i also know that obtaining a high paying career and actually doing something you enjoy a great path to success.
i guess i try to understand the world around me and understand how things work.
physics is one of the classes i told myself in high school that i will never take unless i have to.
"therefore, for the rest of this paper, i am going to plagiarize a movie synopsis to take the rest of the room."
it helps me feel like an expert on subjects and have an open space with classmates who are struggling with the same things i am.
"i have learned a lot since being here and i cant wait to learn more not only about myself, but about becoming a doctor as well as learning new things in the world."
i am excited to see what will happen with these two classes.
i enjoy doing these calculations as well.
"i also want to be able to gain the experience as a college student and by doing so, i would need to expand my horizons by connecting with others from different backgrounds and ages."
i am here for many of reasons.
since computer engineering is also an engineering degree its requirements are very similar to electrical engineering which means all the same science class.
started gyming again.
"ive taken a calculus course before in my sophomore year of high school and received a b, but in all honesty i have no idea how i got that grade."
i want to be part of a change like this.
"it seems very relevant to many real life problems and basically explains why everything moves or how it works, which i didn't realize before."
"also, because the class is a few hours before my cell biology class, i know that i will be spending more time studying because i will be on campus."
i'm here to explore and find my own meaning in life and learn along the way.
i studied a couple times with people in my class but not enough.
"i know through this field, i'd be able to make a lot of money, so much as to where i want have to worry about finances anymore."
it is a diverse community and it is a place where i feel happy.
i have been in school for a while and i am looking forward to be able to start my career and travel the world (once the pandemic is over).
i am here to make a change in the world.
the stem field has many opportunities for people to choose from and it wasn't difficult finding what to to do.
i am also really interested in the human body and how it works.
it is also a great class to make friends or meet new people that are also taking the same subject as you.
and i am here because i feel like this is where i am destined to be.
he used to take me to construction sites and that really grabed my attention since i was young.
"when getting more specific towards the question of why am i here? i would say that i am generally just taking this class because it is required for my major..however, i am specifically taking this lab because i did not pass my lab last semester."
i am also here studying at sfsu as a biology major because i would eventually like to go into doing my own research.
"my schedule is a little overwhelming right now and i felt that although i succeeded in chem 115, i know chem 215 has more to do with math and i thought this course would help to structure my learning and force me to study the lecture notes."
"i know it will be impossible to learn everything, but i am curious about how things in our world works."
another part to mention is that a lot of classes currently at any school are online so it brought me to this class.
i'm here in order to get some lab experience for physics related topics.
which i want to eventually repay them for everything they've done for me.
"after moving to san francisco from southern california, specifically carson, i know that i am here for my education only."
physics turns people into problem solvers and that theres more than one way to think and get an answer.
why am i here..
"i am taking this physics class because i need it to graduate, but i am also always open to new knowledge."
i did not know what to expect for my first semester out here so i also decided to enroll in this course for safety measures just to make sure my first semester alone would go by more smoothly..
"when i say that, i mean: the idea of revisiting physics is not solely to make a living hell in my life, but to allow me to refine my quantitative reasoning skills before taking mcat, and to thoroughly learn physics in its bits and pieces like i did not receive that chance to before."
the reason im in this class is to fill my requirement.
for me it's a step towards a bigger goal in my life which is to graduate and get into a dpt program.
why am i here?i am here because of my passion for the medical field and my wanting of continuing education.
thats just one example of how i think technology can change the world.
i honestly didnt know what to do for the longest time but i found an interest on cars and i would like to work for a good car dealership and fix cars.
the breaking point for my mother was the death of my grandmother.
"but im glad im finally here, although school is online."
"i can't say i am the biggest fan of physics, but i do enjoy solving problems so i hope to be able to understand the work i do as well as be able to apply what i learn in other areas."
other then that i am also here because i wanna graduate.
"there, i felt truly wanted and fulfilled with every task i completed for them, both small or large."
i am here because i was put into this world for a reason.
visiting a new environment is a good feeling and puts me in a position where i dont always know everything.
also its a free a for my gpa as long as i show up to the class.
"i have had a lot of trouble with math classes in the past, some of my teachers were absolute nightmares, but so far this physics class doesn't seem too bad."
i also hope that the supplemental class will enforce what we learn in class and help me better apply formulas to the word problems we have for homework.
"i am a third year, a little behind because i declared my major as a sophomore, but still excited to expand my knowledge on physics."
i also really enjoy photography.
i find it fascinating to learn how the moon and the solar system actually works and how earth orbits.
i made a choice to continue my education after high school.
"because when you think about it, the only reason why were here in college, is to get a job that pays better than average."
"as for this class, im here to get all the extra help i can get, especially in calc 2."
it is a great place to breakdown problem by problem as we do not do this in the class lectures.
so come to the united state to compete with few people.
all he does is go over many examples without actually explaining all that well.
why do we exist?
i think only actual physics majors would write something along those lines.
"in addition to this, i do hope to someday make a difference in the world, and strongly believe that i can do so if i pursue a stem related career."
however chem 215 is a harder course and i knew i was going to need more help on it.
i didnt realize it before but physics requires gathering lots of data which is pertinent to many other scenarios.
i believe taking the laboratory along with the lecture can help me to understand the material even better.
ideally i would want to do something i like doing and at the same time it makes me a lot of money.
i think my biggest problem are word problems.
"not really."" he turned away and never spoke to me again."
"i am a computer science major, so besides being required to take the course, i am looking to learn about the process that this course teaches you."
"in a year i lost everything but now that i have come back, it almost feels as if i was meant to be here at this exact time in my life."
"lastly, i am here because i am passionate about my education and i never want to stop learning."
i did not enjoy phys 111 it was hard for me.
"physics is not an easy subject for me, but since it is necessary for my major, i plan to follow through with the course lecture and lab."
"however, i didn't think it is the most important reason."
i am in this specific class because it fits best with my current academic schedule.
"i am someone who loves interacting with people, and i like working in groups."
"my true desire though, is to learn and excel in chemistry, my favorite subject and major."
"i have always had an issue with math, as in i don't know how to start problems."
i was middle school student in japan.
im at sfsu because i am pursuing a bachelors of science degree in biochemistry.
"i am in this world to work, doing any kind of work."
i really hope that this sci class can help me do well in chemistry this semester and the others to follow.
"however, now that i'm in the class, i really enjoyed it, the environment and people are very friendly, and i can really feel that positive energy every time that i join in zoom."
i hope im able to gain more knowledge from these labs.
the reason im here is because i need to get my college education from somewhere and from someone.
stem research is a collective effort that builds on top of each other.
"i am here because i woke up today and i am ready to serve my purpose, whatever it may be."
"by having a slightly more formal setting where there are others participating, i hope to have more confidence to ask my own questions."
what i hope to get out of this sci class is a clear understanding of how to solve and physics problem and be confident that i know how to do it.
i think i'm here because of pressure.
why the switch to engineering?
it takes me time but i get it eventually.
this leads to my story of working in the banking industry for ten years.
"in high school, we mainly learned about newton's law and what forces are."
i realized my passion throughout my whole life has stemmed from my love for animals.
"by this i mean that we have to measure everything, quantify the everyday tasks."
its interesting how deep you can go to ask questions.
then i wondered why i was taking physic 230 and remembered it was a prerequisite for my major.
"hopefully, with the help of this course i am able to have more success with the corresponding course."
the teachers are great and its not a huge party school which i like.
for me part of being in the stem field is for the financial opportunities that i would be opening for myself because the reality is money is a big part of our lives if we like it or not.
"so, i am here for two reasons only, myself, and my goals to obtain a degree so that it may assist me in getting the career i want."
money is such a variable in life and to especially live in the bay area requires money.
"it is not possible to satisfy all of our needs in one lifetime and be truly happy, but what we can do to get super close is to find a purpose."
im here for a couple reasons.
i find it necessary to be challenged in this way because it changes my perception.
im here because i have a love for astronomy and space.
i never viewed my situation as traumatic or permanent but merely a starting point for something valuable.
i remember taking physics back in high school but i don't remember as much about the class.
i am here at sfsu in order to obtain my bachelors of science degree in biology with a concentration of physiology.
"i chose this major because i enjoy science and as much as i wish i was good at it, i suck at math."
i am going to work very hard in this class to achieve this.
"honestly, i have always just been connected to this city."
i loved math growing up and that helped as a deciding factor.
"i am here to earn the best possible grade, and to learn."
"before chem 115 the last time i took chemistry was my sophomore year in highschool, and as a sophomore in college currently, most of the material that i had went over in highschool i had forgotten."
"for one thing, it is a course i have to take concurrently with the lecture course."
my aunt is someone i look up to since she is a radiologist at the stanford medical center in palo alto.
i learn more from hands on experiences and generally more willing to learn when it comes to labs and experiences that involve actual physical involvement.
but also because science has always been my favorite subject and so taking a physics lab interested me a lot more than other labs that were available.
"secondly, i think there are a lot of opportunities in the main parts of the city for my career choice."
i am also here in this class because i need to fulfill my ge requirement.
i am here mainly to help myself with my chemistry class and to better master the material.
but i love this class so fr and the teacher seems really nice and fun.
"all forms of science such as chemistry, biology, and physics occur around us during our day to day lives but we seem to ignore it."
i also want to be able to teach people what i know from coming here.
i decided to take sci 215.
the only thing that helped me was aleks and it has helped me understand concepts.
"i am a stem major, but i have never taken physics before."
i hope that learning these concepts will help me in my career later.
"for engineering, i will definitely need to understand physics because thats mostly what this major is."
"i dont care whether it is small or big, i would be grateful for either."
i think this class can prepare me for the future as much as any other class.
this is good because you can gain a sense of understanding of this class through your peers and helps you be more aware of areas that you don't understand due to group works that is provided.
i am a double major in latinao studies and biology with a concentration in physiology.
it was one of the best experiences i have ever had in a college coarse.
"so only because of the lab, will i give physics a chance, i expect to learn a lot on why things work the way they do."
i've always been fascinated by the ideas and theories that physics is responsible for and engineering combines all different formats of learning.
i feel that astronomy can be a way for me to expand my skills in the science field.
even then i still hope to learn more towards my degree biochemistry.
i am also here to enhance my learning for this subject as well.
in terms of why im here like why do i exist or why am i? i would say because of my parents choosing to have me.
i am here at san francisco state university because i fell in love with the city when i first visited back in 2017.
"when my time is done god will know what ive done, and see that it was beneficial to the world."
"in order to finish reading the book, i have to take this class."
knowing that my work will make a change.
i also think that physics is essential to life and to know how the world works is very important in any major or path you take in life.
as well i hope with this lab class i figure out what i would like to do in the future.
i have heard that physics is not as hard as some of the previous science classes i have had to take for my major.
ive noticed that this semester specifically im a lot more outgoing with talking to people.
the main reason i want to continue going into the stem field is because i think the future of our world depends on it.
"also, i know that i hate writing papers so i also choose a major that has the least amount of writing in it."
it's pretty tricky.
"i am here for a purpose, just like everyone else."
i have been in a sci class before for chemistry 1 and it helped me almost get an a in my class.
surely there must be some metaphysical being that allowed for nature to give rise to such a dominating force of animals.
"i know my purpose for being here, and hopefully i fulfill it while i am."
"with this mindset, i am here because the topics that i will learn in this class such as electrical circuits and electric current can be very useful in the real world; understanding current and flow of electricity can enable me the skills to fix various machines throughout my house."
"i never thought i would be taking an astronomy class, but here i am, and it is extremely interesting."
"i think that im able to understand all of the sciences pretty well, mostly i think because i have a passion for them and make a greater effort to comprehend them."
"but at the same time, i worry about my english ability."
"to live a life that does not solely benefit me, but rather to put another before myself in all situations."
plus the fact that i am trying to graduate before the age of 30 while most of these kids will probably graduate at 2122 sometimes gets the best of me.
i have astronomy lecture 15 min before this lab so it's really helpful to have these back to back so that it is easier to not forget information and to ask follow up questions i still has from the lecture.
"however, i believe that i have the idea of how the class operates, so im sure ill be fine and pass the class."
it doesn't matter what the hell you do.
i didnt want another lecture like class and some of those lecture classes conflicted with my schedule.
currently i am in the physics 222 class to develop a greater understanding of physics.
my mother finally snapped and decided that everything is for nothing.
i wanted to join the stem field because i have always been very obsessed with mathematics and science from a younger age than most.
i signed up for science 115 to get extra help for chemistry 115 class.
being able to get a visual representation on the topics that we talk about makes for a better learning experience.
"since i was young, i have always had a passion for cars."
"this question can have an honest and straightforward answer, which is because this class is a requirement for my degree. therefore, i must complete and pass this class because i need it to receive my diploma."
"dear zhuowa wu,i am here because i am an environmental science major; as such i should be well equip with basic physics amongst other basic sciences such as chemistry."
i am here in this class because it is a required for my degree.
"not only that, but also because this is a required course for my major, but i do enjoy physics."
my main reason for signing up was to spend extra time reviewing as i knew i would have trouble procrastinating this semester wich i am trying to avoid.
advances in tech and software will lead to a world where people can live easily without much waste.
"furthermore, my interest in physics is lacking due to my major."
all i ever want to do is smoke a joint and play video games.
"it is amazing to learn how there are other planets, galaxies, and so many starts outside in outer space."
i chose to take astronomy and astronomy lab because it interested be the most out of all the other science classes offered for my ge requirement.
last semester i was a chemistry la and even i was sh locked when the instructor asked me to be an la for her class because before her chemistry class i thought chemistry was my worse enemy.
"my determination to graduate on time, applying to veterinary school, and found love for science has me driven to taking these types of classes."
they continued to support my dreams and passions no matter the circumstance.
there 1.4 billion people there in china.
"angelina nguyenandrew sturnerphysics 112june 24, 2020reflective journaling 1i never actually took a liking to physics because i always found it to be quite difficult to understand and i had trouble grasping some concepts."
i can learn art on my own time and learn the fun part of game design later but computer science is a skill that i lack so i need to challenge myself so i can not take an easy root and get better in life.
you can take that in many different directions.
my main goal is to learn.
and theres about zero chance im getting that this semester.
it seemed like the responsible decision to make.
"since i have never taken any kind of physics class, the topic does kind of scare me, and knowing that its based on algebra, trigonometry, and geometry does make me nervous."
i am going into the stem field to try and address problems that are facing the world today.
i decided mine to simply be to experience life.
simply this course is a major requirement.
when i decided to drop the lecture class i had to weigh the reasoning behind staying in this class vs.
the way i interpret the question is either as a philosophical question or asking why i am actually in the class.
i also have to take physics 2 next semester so i would like to have a firm understanding of the basic concepts before they get even more complicated.
but the homework on aleks also isnt very helpful for me because it feels like i'm trying to punch through a brick wall without knowing there are tools better suited for the job.
"i am computer science major so it may not be directly related, but the scientific process and experiments as well as the thought process can be transferred universally with all other science fields."
5 minutes of reflective journaling should result in an essay of about 150200 words.
"john henry skinner phys 11209 r 9320i think this one is actually pretty straightforward for me, because it's centered around a call i've already had to make."
i mean i dont really know why i am here.
i try to spend more time studying for physics compared to my other classes.
i is a hard goal to achieve but hopefully my passion can drive me to my destination.
i took the prerequisites class last year in order to join this class.
"the standard i set for myself is very low, but i hope to change that."
i've had a pretty bad physics class experience because i couldn't fully understand what the teachers are trying to teach.
now with that out of the way i will talk about why i am literally here right now.
"other times im so grateful to have made a big step and change attending sfsu, i've changed so much and so has my perspective slowly but surely developing with such rich information i have obtained since arriving here."
that is why i am at san francisco state.
this is the main reason im here; because it is a requirement in order for me to acquire my bachelors degree.
the field seemed perfect to me.
to have a better understanding of this i am glad im given the opportunity to learn more about astronomy.
and to have a job where i get to see animals all day and make them feel better from whatever ills them would make me so happy.
i hope to do well in this class and i plan on putting a lot of effort in achieving a good grade.
and i belong to the school of thought that you shouldn't dwell on these things too hard if you want to avoid an existential crisis.
i took physics in high school and i learned a lot then and i just want to keep learning and get a better inside of the subject itself.
it can have many different contexts that it can be used in.
"i do like the fact that i was able to be a zoology major, but i don't feel like i've gotten the full college experience."
ive been taking the class for a bio major but i dont seem to be more passionate about the major.
physics can be interesting depending on the student and the teacher.
i dont have a strong background in mathematics or problem solving skills yet every time i enter a new class filled with people who are over confident and think they can ace thee class without trying.
if something i can make or contribute my efforts to can make that happen that would be satisfying to me.
although physics is a mixture of science and math i think it'll come in handy for the future.
"sf state has a great kinesiology department for me to take classes for my career, even though it is severely impacted."
it really fascinates me how you can actually use math to figure out how objects behave and why they behave like that.
i am taking physic classes because i am majoring in biology in physiology as a focus.
"one one hand, leaving to such a far distance from home to attend university is not what i first expected."
i an here at sfsu for 2 reasons.
i initially entered college with a business major.
the tools and knowledge used in this course only align with a very specific subset of the entirety of my career path.
i am currently taking this physics 111112 class because it is a requirement for my major.
ive had good times and bad times with science over audrey my school years back in middle school i had to my opinion one of the best physics teachers and he started a sparking me that started liking science but after that the other teachers i had just made me dislike science overall and not show up to class.
"if the question is for the purpose of getting me to question my existence, then it worked."
"one could say i am here now because i have not done the requirements needed before freshman year, namely precalculus."
"because their purpose is no longer there, they have been there for a long time, and they no longer have a purpose."
"i am here because despite all the order that needs to be in place for our universe and the things in it to be in relative equilibrium, i am a product of the spontaneity of our universe."
sometimes i am not ready for things and rush into them.
"as for why am i in the astronomy lab, it is because i have always been curious about astronomy and wanted to know what it feels like to learn and be taught about it and visit the planetarium.being here feels nice as there are people to interact and share stories with, there are places to connect to and there are memories made and moments lived."
the only thing i can think of is maybe it assists in nutrient cycling?
"i originally wanted to move to la or san diego, san diego state was originally my first choice."
i did not actually allow myself to really try to understand the materials before giving up.
"overall, i am excited to learn some new things in this class and i will work hard to make sure that i understand what is being taught."
im not a huge fan of physics largely because it been a subject that has been extremely difficult for me.
i am a visual learner and for me bio 230 is not a long enough class to accomplish the kind of learning i need.
"you need all four of those things to understand how life works on earth and i have taken classes on all those subjects, except for physics, so i felt i was missing parts of my understanding of the world."
apparently my schedule that i have does not meet the hours they are open so its difficult to get materials .
"i am excited to see what this virtual lab will bring, even though i know it will be a little more challenging to get the same experience as face to face classes."
"i originally wanted to study zoology and become a zoologist, but my confidence and passion for the goal has diminished over the years."
"that's as far as i know at time of writing, at least."
"its my first sci class so im still trying to see how this is structured and how i can make it work for me, because the sci is designed to help me, but as im doing physics, im realizing that theres lots of different ways of seeing and understanding the concepts."
a question that can only be answered within your inner self.
i am in physics 23206 specifically because it is the best time for me to have this lab.
earlier in life i couldn't decide what i wanted to major in but recently computer majors have expanded beyond computer science which was the catch all of the computer degree.
i am here in the east bay because it is where i was born and raised my whole life.
"i hope to take in as much information i can from this class, and bring it into the real world when i finally leave."
i never understood the concepts behind phyiscs and now that im in this class its becoming more and more clear.
"there is no reason or rhyme to why each of us are here, but it is our duty to discover what that means for us, individually."
though this class is a requirement for my major zoology i have a strong passion for questioning the world as we know it.
im hoping to work and interact with my group and develop my skill more.
i dont want to fail again and i also would like to understand it.
i'm taking this class in order to complete my course requirments.
"i took some time off school, and decided to come back the next semester (now) because school was always really important to jordan, and i have been really focused on not letting him down."
"but when i moved to sf, i met so many new people and was able to gain new perspectives on life, school, and other things as well."
im here because i want a better future.
i think that theyre really important to know and how stuff works.
understanding the concepts helps with comparing it to real life situations.
there are a couple of reasons why i want to go into the stem field.
but i am glad that i like physics so that i am able to enjoy the class while i learn.
5 minutes to talk about why i think i am here..
one more reason is that am not too much into leterature or medical fields.
"its still a challenge and i am not extremely good, but i know that if i try my best i can still achieve decent grades."
my career goal is to become a cosmeticplastic surgeon so i am unsure about how i will integrate physics with that.
"since the age of ten i would watch project runway and was obsessed with the design people would make, consistently figuring out what was great about them and what i would fix."
"i have never taken a physics class before, so i thought it would be helpful to take a sci class, which would boost my knowledge and give me extra skills to pass my physics class."
"i do not like feeling like i'm wasting my time in class simply because i don't need this course, not because the class itself is so bad."
"however, i intend to learn more from this course as a i have limited knowledge of physics."
"i found my calling in the sciences and am now pursuing a career in child psychiatry am here because i want to not only better my own life, but better the lives of others to the best of my ability."
i'm here in this class because it is a requirement for my intended major which is zoology.
"i have never taken a physics class before, but i love science in general and am excited to learn how things work in the world and, more importantly, being able to do some practical use in this lab course."
if we are talking about this specific class i am here primarily as a prereq for biomechanics.
"i was never the ""straight a"" student that people percieve me to be...."
i am here to learn more about the topic that we see in class but are generally less tangible to let me and others better understand how the processes work in real life or to just experience them.
i also think i would not be here at this school to even be taking this class in the rst place.
you can see the way peoples face lights up when they see someone who looks like them and speaks their language.
i discussed the different pathways with my parents.
"i grew tired of working long hours, hurting my body and serving people."
"i literally use math for anything like calculating how much time i have to get ready and do my make up, how long it's going to take to get to school, to make food."
people around the clock trying to decide what aspects of their lives involve only needs or wants.
"i thought to myself, what would the harm be in taking a si course?"
i think for the most part i always overcomplicate the problem when its actually fairly simple.
i know i matter to people but to the whole universe i really dont know.
well this is a class i require for my major as a cell biologist.
i am here because i enjoy learning about things that affect humanity on a daily basis and are always at work.
now that we have separated we are both attending school using our benefits that we earned through serving.
i am not bad at math but i always seem to struggle with word problems specifically and physics is all word problems.
i find the field to be very interesting and i can see myself enjoying it for the rest of my life.
i need both structure and freedom.
i am very interested in this field.
i also hope to remember them in the future.
i am in the sci class because i also would like a gpa booster.
i am here so i can learn more about physics and fulfill requirements for sfsu. i wouldn't take physics if i didn't have to but i think i will learn new problem solving skills and techniques to deal with mathematical equations.
going to a class which helps me study and manage my time.
i start thinking of other ways in which it will be easier for me to understand concepts and not just solving or getting the right answer.
this is a prerequisite for other upper division classes that i must take to complete my coursework at sfsu.
"so far in my tough journey i have a little bit of slack on me, so i have to pace myself and pick it up so i can overcome my obstacles and get through this and please my mum and make her proud."
i can also correlate that with the calculus thati've been taking.
you so know that the time allotted for the professors are not enough to begin with.
i took a year break between between calculus one and calculus two.
"in addition, i feel like college is one of the milestones in life that a good amount of people should accomplish in their life."
"i took classes that were relatively easy but still managed to get a d and one c. you would think that if your classes are easy, you would ace all of them right?"
i havent been able to choose what career path i want to take for college because i was too indecisive of what i wanted to major in.
"this class, though, is presenting the material in a clear manner and the instructor is explaining the concepts well."
"by enrolling in this sci chemistry course, im learning to apply lecture concepts onto real world applications."
i am here because i am dedicated to my success in my stem based courses.
"however, my opinions and views have drastically changes since starting classes at san francisco state university."
"for example, so far we have been looking at unit conversions, rates of change, dimensional consistencies, and such and i am sure that this will help me in classes such as in the sciences and math that i will have to take in the future."
to have knowledge about the way things work and relate to each other is a powerful skill.
i think the reason that i am here is to complete my physics classes.
im taking this physics course because it is a prerequisite for medical school.
this is phys 222 so the labs are not that much complicated as higher level courses.
it is difficult but i enjoy problem solving so i enjoy stem topics.
which just gives us the ability to calculate the velocity or acceleration of the thrown object at a given time but i do not necessarily know how to arrive at the equation if we were to actually perform the experiment in real life.
i especially love life sciences and marine biology.
i like how the things we learn in physics to be applied in real life.
i can code on complex problems and i like to do that.
"for example, i gave my mother and dad a daughter."
i am taking physics 111112 because i am a prebio major and it is a requirement to take physics.
i am currently here because this class is required for me to get my degree.
"i was thinking a director, editor, or producer."
"3 years ago i was living on the east coast and was wanting to go to college there, but then i decided to move out to california with my mom."
ive now switched over to computer science and am intrigued by everything from artificial intelligence to web development.
even with this kidney stone i still do my best to come to class through the pain.
life works in mysterious ways and mannn am i learning a whole lot.
i am here in this class because of many different outcomes that came together to bring me to this class on a specific time of day.
to me its so crazy how the universe is so big to put it simply.
"in order to become a marine biologist, you need at least a masters degree."
"so far, i think my nervousness was unwarranted because i feel pretty comfortable with the material that ive learned in class so far."
"nowadays we only take classes like these to pass, not to learn."
my uncle worked as an electrical engineer and when he visited us he would let me work with him.
its something ive kinda slacked on a bit but not too much.
i don't know if it was the way it was taught but i had a difficult time grasping information.
"as an athlete, having time to study can be hard to manage sometimes so going to sci once a week acts as a review for a week."
that's why i am here in this supplementary course.
i am also taking physics because it will help me prepare for the dat exam that i plan on taking later this year.
i attend because i am motivated to succeed.
i am the first in my family to attempt to get into med school.
i am currently undeclared but i am thinking about declaring my major to political science.
i got to work with design engineers and civil as well.
i am taking this supplementary portion to solidify my knowledge i learn in class and to foster my overall understanding.
these just are the reasons why im in here.
this physics course is a requirement for me in order to achieve my degree.
i would probably start to relate everything i see with the concepts and formulas i have learned and started to explain to my friends.
this is my first physics class i've taken since freshman year of high school and i didn't do so good in that class because i thought i wouldn't do anything with sciences or math so why bother learning this.
i think this question can be answered in many ways.
physics is not my favorite subject because it involves a lot of math that i do not enjoy doing.
i think it is about being able to think critically.
"when i think about why am i here, many questions arise like why am i in this class?"
"i really enjoy learning about biology but it wasn't always my major, for a time i majored in computer science."
i just need to finish my classes as fast as possible i dont want to be a burden to my mom when i need money.
one of my classes was talking about binary numbers and computers.
"as far as why i'm in this class, of course its a requirement for me to take this class but even if physics isn't really my strong suite, it's still science and i love science and i'm excited to know other science other than anatomy."
i am here in this class because i want a little extra help in my physics course.
"i started with a biology concentration then i tried anthropology, psychology and even trade."
i really hope that i am able to change peoples live for the better.
this is a very standard answer but it goes more into that.
"but aside from that, im here because once again overall, i want to be successful."
going to a lab is good too because you can see how all the concepts play out.
"after you finish your essays, we will provide some class time to discuss your thoughts, to the extent that you feel comfortable sharing."
"if someone were to ask me why are you here?, i wouldn't know how to go about answering the question in a way that will explain all the reasons why i was placed on this earth."
"everyone made their mistakes and their successes in life, so i try not to think too much about either one of those."
"honestly, i think i'm here by some sort of luck."
i wanted to take physics 111 because i took physics in high school and i'm more familiar with these concepts then say chemistry or biology.
i also want to know what are the different objects we are able to see only through telescopes and not with our own eyes.
with school life it really hasn't been fare to me.
this allow me to focus on what i really need to study for the exam.
i had never been to the library nor had i ever been able to pick something that i wanted to read.
i am here in physics to learn how physics applies to my major of physiology.
"there are many opportunities that await, and branches will keep expanding from what stem can do."
i'm here so people dont look at me as a failure.
"i'm here because i struggle a lot with science classes, and talking to people to form a study group."
so i am here to represent and to make my family proud.
"although this class is a general education requirement the moon, stars, and space have always piqued my curiosity despite my lack of knowledge of the subject."
the reason why im taking this tutoring course for calculus 2 is because i felt as though my foundation for calculus 1 may not be as strong as i need it do be.
this school is also pretty good to transfers and accepts your application without too much hassle.
but why am i in this class?
you may ask why i was born in a house?
i come here to learn more about concepts that physics has in general.
the amount of genuine joy and fulfillment i get from existing in the same time period as some of my amazing friends and family really is what drives me in life and i think thats why i am here.
i have friends and family in china but why am i here.
so the extra help will give me motivation and confidence while doing assignments at home.
i feel that everyone has a purpose on this earth and my reason here is to have a name for myself.
"the professor may not always have time to cover everything in detail during class time, so sci 321 is a good opportunity for me to ask more in depth questions and think critically about the material."
it consists of knowing what physics is and applying it to the real world and knowing what all equations mean.
i'm looking forward to the rest of this semester!
"i assume that rates of change, what we are looking at right now, can probably be very helpful for me to understand the field i am studying."
i feel that the physics and chem attracts me.
i choose to be in college as i will choose whether or not i can excel to succeed in all my courses.
some say that college is not necessary to get a good job and i believe that they are correct.
it's really weird.
"to be specific about this class, i am here because it is a requirement for my major."
"i believe, the sci class provides the details that give depth to the physics concept."
i am here at sfsu for a multitude of reasons.
i also like the idea of being able to review the concepts right after class so the timing of this class best works for my schedule.
in deciding to enroll for those classes and committing for a while it was clear to me that an education in the stem field would suit me perfectly since i rater enjoyed covering math and science subjects in school.
"i already took the regular astronomy class, and during that class the teacher asked us to break off into pairs and discuss this same question."
i am here because i was born in this world.
i remember i did enjoy physics but i was taking my physics course in ccsf and not in sfsu. its been over 2 years since i took physics so everything is new to me.
i like experimenting things and working with hardware more than solving theoretical problems which is totally different when i am solving a software problem.
i know that im being productive in class and im not distracted on my phone and i can ask other classmates for help.
i am also here to help open doors for myself in the future and reach greater opportunities.
why am i here?i'm here to help.
why am i here?i will start by saying that im in college to expand my mind and knowledge in various topics.
senior year my purpose was to help others solve their own problems and find ways to promote mental health.
"sometimes it gets boring and hard, but it is fun once you start to understand how it works."
"if we fail to find our purpose, we find questions like ""why am i here?"" difficult to answer."
"second, i also am here for another reason besides technicalities...but on a universal level."
i have always enjoyed going to school and learning new things.
then i will rejoice in my accomplishments for a short while and after that i will get a job because it is what is expected of me.
i like this class because they go over important information that will for sure be on the exam.
elena mena why am i here i am here because this is a required class for my major.
"with both of these two facts laid out, this explains why i am currently taking lab 232."
"something, a goal, i have always wanted for myself is to be financially stable and be able to comfortably provide for myself."
although this course is simply a requirement i hope to learn something beneficial and change the way i think about things.
so thats the first reason i decided to major in astrophysics.
"by incorporating my knowledge of politics in san franciscomy lifelong homei aim to forward medical and computational ethics, fields that pioneer life in silicon valley and modern medicine."
i want to do medical research on miscarriages.
"all in all, id say im here for a variety of reasons for a variety of answers."
i spent much of my time outside of the house trying to stay busy.
"during this physics lab, i got the chance to know more scientific skills."
i already do not like chemistry classes and after a couple classes i realized i would do really bad in quanatiatve chemical analysis if it were not for this sci class.
i am here in this physics class because it is a prerequisite for my major.
i value kindness and happiness.
i am also here in this lab to get a better understanding of the material and to ace this class.
i am here so that i can get a better understanding for the concepts of biology.
"i also want to get a better educations, get a better job, preferably one with advancement opportunities."
i always hated physics back in high school.
if i didn't need physics for my major i don't think i would have ever taken this class of my own volition.
i am honeestlly confused on if its talking about this class or in general.
i am in this class because i have taken supplemental instruction in the past and i believe it is really helpful.
ive only been into one class of sci 111 so far and it is definitely helpful.
"why i am here is a hard question for me to answer in a short 5minute reflection but, i will summarize to the best of my ability."
especially since it was my first semester here at sf state.
i am here because i have to be.
molst people live without thinking a single thought and choosing different things that can shape their life and others in different ways.
years later i am so glad that i made this decision because i would not be who i am today had i not.
physics to me has a lot of complicated parts and a lot of formulas.
"i think physics is a really difficult subject in general, and being in the lab and using handson learning abilities helps us understand what is actually going on, rather than just giving students a problem and doing the math for it."
"while this doesnt directly relate to programming, it is still useful to recognize the flow of electrons in circuits and having a better understanding of charges in general."
"i applied for a few schools, and for some reason sf state accepted me, so here i am, in gradstudent leslies class."
i am interested in physics because i am a surfer and lover of the ocean.
the last time i took a sci course was about a year ago and it was for csc220.
if i did not take the lab class i would have been dropped.
math because im just at least good in solving math problems and using equations and science because it has interesting topics such as electricity for example.
i hope this has reached the required word count.
"ive heard that people who take sci do better in the course and while i feel like i wouldve somewhat been fine without taking it, i dont regret taking this course."
i would go out and practice during breaks or before and after those piano classes because it was something that i enjoyed doing.
i look forward to furthering my understanding of the physical world.
"i, however, do not find physics easy or intriguing which is why i am only here because it is required of me."
i can make analogies in my head easier and i can also explain what ive learned a whole lot better.
i'm starting to learn some of the concepts i was supposed to learn in astr 115 and i really like the hands on nature even though i have to work pretty hard at understanding the information i feel like.
helping others out in the way and spreading the knowledge i have on certain topics within people.
this lab will help in understanding the basic concept and will also help in providing reasons to know how and why; these things happened.
i think my family got lucky as they bought our how when we were young right before houses began to cost a really large amount.
"often times, i can be very pessimistic and i eventually come to the conclusion that life has no meaning."
"right after graduating high school, i ended up not going to the university i was going to go to and instead took a semester off doing many things thinking about what i wanted to do for the rest of my life."
asking questions is the main way to succeed and practicing math problems makes you succeed.
i am in physics because i need to take the class.
"in a broader sense, i am here because my future pretty much depends on it."
it has always been easier for me to do the math than it seems to be for other people.
"school is hard enough as it is, but having sci is something that we cannot take for granted as we only have so many classes they are available for."
overall this is the only science with a lab that i thought i would be semi successful in.
"but when you really look at the stuff that one can learn in a physics lab, it just makes it much more appealing and hands on."
"however, that doesnt mean that im here purely out of requirement and not out of interest."
i enjoy learning and working in the stem field is a constantly changing environment where continuing to learn is important to succeed.
"i am a stem major and my general education requirements require me to take this class, so the fact that i find physics a little interesting will help me get through this course and learn a lot."
i decided to take this supplemental sci class for many different reasons.
i feel like learning physics is going to further help me in my future endeavors.
it all revolves around money.
"because of these worries, i will go above and beyond to ensure that my knowledge of these concepts is strong before attempting to learn a new one."
"my interest is specifically in automotive engineering, so a wellfounded knowledge of physics is critical to doing an efficient job of that."
i am lucky i have the freedom and priveledge to be here.
im here because my sisters are also here and they mean a lot to me.
ive also heard a lot of stories about how difficult organic chemistry can be.
i also have not done an actual physics lab in a while so i think it will be interesting to see what we learn about in action.
"i hope our professor stays this cool and doesnt change, he's really cool the way he is."
i am sitting in this chair because i am enrolled in physics 2 with calc and the supplemental lab.
"by going to school teaching this class, i am able to gain perspectives sufficient knowledge to provide a helping hand to all."
i am here to provide more time to my family.
but then there's physics.
"this course teaches you about physics and how everything in the world works and normally as a human being with two eyes, what i learn from physics is something that one cannot see with the naked eye and i find that fascinating because you are learning the formulas but also you are learning the secrets of the world in the form of numbers to be able to comprehend it with the human mind."
i am nervous that i might have a hard time in this class because everyone i know that has taken a physics course always deems it as difficult.
inall honesty if i had the choice to be taking physics 2 i really wouldnt.
working that job made me feel so whole and like i had done something with my life.
"the current math teachers are frustrating but they are the top brass and if i need to advance in my career and life, i really need to learn from these guys or i am not going to get anywhere."
"i wouldnt have enough work experience to make a living by myself and with the knowledge i had after high school, i wasnt confident as i didnt have much of a good education."
physics isnt an easy subject to learn.
so to actually be here in physics 2 studying for a civil engineer is huge accomplishment for me.
i also think that its pretty cool to learn how things work and to have at least some knowledge of physics.
i also want to get a general knowledge of physics.
"biology has always been interesting to me, because of how it can explain many things i do not know about living things."
on the other hand my fantasy football team is pretty good.
looking forward to a great and productive semester!
"this is my first semester at sfsu, i am a transfer student from southern california (sylmar)."
"even though this is the reason i am taking this class, i am still excited to learn more about physics."
some of the concepts that i am very eager to learn are electricity of the energy portion and sound waves.
i chose computer science because it empowers me.
"as a biology major, we are here to find new ways to cure diseases and find ways to make the earth more livable in."
physics 230 and its accompanying lab section 232 are both required courses for a computer science degree.
the main reason i am here is because it is needed for my major.
"however, she does not give foundation for what shes explaining and assumes everyone is on her page."
"ive always wondered what the concept of physics is, so i hope to learn many new things this year."
i attended college of marin before transferring to sfsu this spring.
overall i am here for my future.
to for fill my dreams of actually doing something that i really like and becoming successful on what i do.
"also, i do have an interest in becoming a video game developer, more of an interest in open world simulation games such as grand theft auto, because behind all of the obscene video game humor is a world that is simulated to act like ours and able for the user to traverse."
"i know we might not even find the answers to those questions in my lifetime and maybe in hundred of life times, but we have to start somewhere."
"i also want to represent my latino community in stem because i feel like there is not enough latinos in stem. science has always interested me, but i also knew that it is not easy but since i really find science subjects to be really interesting i figured it would be worth the hard work."
"i am majoring in biochemistry, so i have a couple of lowerdivision science classes that i need to take."
i seem to understand what type of work we have to do and what labs are.
huiping dowdell science 321 reflective journaling essay 1 6 february 2020 why am i here? i am here at sfsu as a transfer student majoring in biochemistry.
i am looking forward to applying the knowledge i learn here in my future courses.
i look forward to spending the semester learning more through this course and applying that knowledge in my career and daily life.
a convoluted question.
"i also took a sci class for calc one and even though i didn't pass the class it helped me understand the material, and i got an a in clac the next semester."
"it made me question how, and who came up ideas like this."
"i took ap physics in high school 3 years ago, but i didn't pass the test."
"the way that i was brought up, my parents have always told me if not school then what is the key to success?"
i'm of the opinion that this will be helpful when i have to work with other engineers.
i ask myself this question every chance i get.
being away from home in a new city has taught me so many things especially about myself.
my purpose is to succeed and learn along the way and that is why i am present and here today.
one thing i also enjoy about the labs are that i get to visualize things a lot easier.
i was more of a critical thinker than an artist.
i dont really know much about physics and the last physics class i took was in middle school.
"i exist thanks to her, and in a lot of ways i believe that the purpose, more than how i came to be, is driven by her own existence."
i am in this class because it is a requirement and prerequisite to future classes and also because i need to know these things for the future.
"""why am i here?"" i saw this question as why am i in school."
i also think i am here based on my past experiences.
by me being here in school and pursuing a career in the medical field i feel like i can make a huge impact by reducing the numbers of miscarriages and change the statistics of it.
i chose astronomy 115 because of ge requirement of the university.
"on this journey, i had to make many decisions that would best benefit me and my life."
the reason that i am here is to further my understanding of the concepts in calculus 2.
"first of all, i need this class to fulfil my units because in order to be qualified for financial aid, i must need at least 12 units and above."
"i always visited mexico and would see that when trying to access their form of a hospital or emergency room, it was always a struggle for families."
this class is excellent for me because it helps your gpa and helps you with the actual class.
the reason i am here in this class is to be able to succeed in bio 230 and learn to develop my study skills because i have a learning disability that sometimes makes it hard for me to learn like your typical student i tend to think differently.
this class will help me better understand the universe.
"otherwise, im just here to do my best and make the most of my time here in college."
this is why i am taking it again in college.
maybe knowing wavelengths and rays of light might help with cold laser therapy and maybe knowing how buoyancy works when it comes to water therapy.
whether it39;s for my future biology classes or just in life.
these are the reasons why i wanted to go into the stem field.
"this was in efforts to escape the toxic environment i grew up in virginia, like a clean slate, i wished to make a change for the positive."
im assuming you want an answer saying that were here because we want to be?
i actually have to take something over the summer to make up for a class i couldn't add.
asking questions when i am unsure of anything and preparing myself with the best of my ability and doing the very best i can to succeed in all of my classes.
i think that's really a big difference between what i like to do and what i have to do.
being a kinesiology major we study the bodies and how they move.
being in this class has taught me that theyre very different concepts.
it is also good for me because i have always been good in the science and mathematics field.
"i enjoyed all of the fun labs that we did in that class, and i have fond memories from being able to use those skills during my engineering courses."
i feel like i never really want to join or need the supplemental science course offered alongside to the main course whenever i'm attending a course but it doesn't hurt to try the class out.
"other than nonprogramming classes, there still seems to be many courses that i still have to take that focus primarily on my degree.that's why i'm here."
i come straight from work so i am usually late and then i am here sweating.
"i want to make an impact in this world, even if it is a small dent."
and i got my good friend here taking the class together which means it more enjoyable
i am a biology major with a focus in zoology and i am very passionate about animals and conservation.
i'm from iraq and i lived there until 2013.
and the class is huge so the professors cant check for understanding with every single student.
i have taken another sci class last semester and it did help a lot and also the a really helps your gpa. taking these sci courses really does help with understanding lecture.
i am really hoping sci 111 can help me understand my homework so i can do well in the class.
this is such an open ended question.
"after i finish the high school i decided move to bay area to continue my college, i went to the dvc in pleasant hill, and right there i studied two yearsthen i transfer to the san francisco state university."
it made me more confident in myself to choose what is best for me.
people believed in the rocket was an expensive thing.
john ellis jr2182020i am here in this sci class for a few different reasons.
and if i can change a few people's life at a certain moment in time then so be it.
the final reason is that it pays well.all of these reasons kind of link together.
i ended the semester with a b and i thought after getting such a good grade personally for me i would give it another try.
i know going over for the information even if i already know it will help me a lot.
this is not meant to be a formal essay.
because before i had 10 units because i was only enrolled in biol 240 and chem 115 which are both 5 unit classes.
"also, i believe the sci class for chem 215 will possibly help me form new study groups, so that i can efficiently study the material at hand."
but this dream ended up sticking with me for the duration of my educational career and is the reason that i am attending san francisco state today.
i rather have an idea on how to do something than not knowing what i am doing.
"i am here at san francisco state university because i wanted to be able to be far from home, but not too far."
i am here because i really want to learn about the basic concepts of physics.
in high school i opted out of physics and took courses like physiology and forensics science.
i hope that after taking this class i will see how i can apply physics to my daily life or how it is important in my life.
i am also here because i took the astronomy lecture class in the spring of 2019.
the general explanation in class becomes clearer after sci. the course length allows me to ask questions in a setting where the pressure of time isn't pushing me to rush through and just understand half of the concept.
i learned a lot in the class and always looked forward to learning new topics.
for example the equation for an object throw (the parabola) is just given such as something like 16t2 8t 32.
a more comprehensive understanding of kinesiology through physics should prove to be useful throughout med school as well as beyond.
i am taking the regular fiftyminute class monday through friday right before this class time.
we see humans destruction of the planet and how useless humans are in this grand universe.
i am here because i need to fulfill a ge requirement.
the lecture is very interesting.
i have nothing against physics when it comes to the math part but if i have to think about it or explain it conceptional then yea i have some problems.
i think that is why this course is being set up in this way.
online classes have impacted my learning quite a lot.
ive been behind on that.
"the reason for why my sister took responsibility for the care taking of my mother, instead of my father, was because my father was diagnosed with ptsd and was mentally abusive."
one moment i'm resting peacefully in a warm bath.
the reason i choose to add this class was that i felt the need for extra help in biology 240.
"my sisters, friends, etc."
i believe everyone who comes into your life is there for a reason.
"why am i here?this is a very broad question, with many possible answers."
i am mostly interested in artificial intelligence and robotics.
the material formation of this proactiveness has taken form in the sci class.
never took physics so im excited to even take physics lab because i am a hands on learner which allows me to focus on whats important and how i can challenge myself.
"ive tried to take this class earlier during the last fall semester but unfortunately, i had to drop because the class was getting harder as well as my other classes at the time."
i am here because i am following my dreams.
"we are all here for a purpose, and as of right now my purpose is obtaining the best possible grade in this class and learning as much as i can."
"in other terms, i am feeling unsure about my current position being a bio major, going to school here."
while physics is not my academic focus it is important for my biology major.
if i was writing a patients state on their charts.
"as a computer science student, this schools location allows me to be motivated by seeing the innovations being made in this same city."
"therefore, i really hope that i can do this at university and i wasn't a bit bitter to register for physics class this term."
reflective journaling essay 1russell wongsci033302why am i here?why am i here?
this is my second time attempting to complete physics ( the first attempt i withdrew within the first two weeks; the information was so dense and uninteresting).
"im a freshman and i have 230232 and 240242, i figured itd be better to try and finish all of these types of courses first so that i could go into things that were a little more exiting like intro to quantum or theoretical."
i am here in san francisco all the way from los angeles to get my degree.
"its also pretty chill because its one day a week on a monday, and mondays are the day i allocate to handle most of my schoolwork so that worked out well for me."
that kept me going and really motivated me to keep doing well.
"also, physics will help me understand how the technology works."
"i am in sci so i can meet people that have the same goal as me, which is to pass the class and understand it well enough to pass physics 121."
"if you want to be successful in life in america, you got to follow the system."
i took care of my mother and realized how delicate her mind was.
through physics labs i can see and understand concepts from lecture more clearly and get a better understanding of the material.
but that not the main reason why.
"although i am not a morning person, i am excited to get started and start chipping away at the lab manual!"
"it's crazy to me that i'm here in my second year already, about to start working harder and harder to get that degree."
"science is constantly evolving and improving, but now we need a nother big shift in technology to be able to help change this world for the better."
i have no specific direction in my life other than the general goal i have always had since i knew how to talk.
i purposely chose not to be a nurse.
"yes, i know there are other options to be successful, like vocational school but i dont feel confident or comfortable enough to be successful without one."
"that's also the reason why i took this class specifically because it will help me get into a dpt school, it's one of the required prerequisites before applying."
but since it relates to my major it relates to the reason i chose my major.
"i am also interested in learning and developing myself, and this is why i am here."
i like to know how there is so many different roads to take for a certain topic by just speaking to others.
"diversity is very important because, with different backgrounds, a person can gain experience in something that they havent done before or perceived something in a new way."
that is why i have been taking many sci classes is because it gives me an opportunity to learn by others and make friends with different people.
so i ended up choosing sfsu.
i feel i signed up for this class because it seems that chemistry is going to prove difficult for me.
also i was interested in the factory machinery inside of food plants because of how complex tasks were automated by the machines.
"my purpose, my dreams, and ambitions lie beyond the realm of academia."
i would also like to travel as much as i can to get exposure to places around the world.
the factbased approach of something i see is applicable to many aspects of life.
my now self and my future self.
i could also say that i am here (literally) because i have to be.
"therefore, i am taking this class to be able to move forward towards my degree and towards other physics and engineering courses."
i knew what gravity and acceleration was before i came to the class but i knew physics had a ton of math and math isnt really my strong suit.
i suppose that in a few years i will look back and hopefully be okay with where i am then.
the alma journal was onlhy at 182 words.
i am here because i need help with organic chemistry and the material we are going over.
i have always been afraid of the math portion of physics because math isnt my strong suit.
i am also here at san francisco state because i love the diversity and opportunity that is all around me here.
"whether that is inside the class, people surrounding us, and even ourselves."
also when i signed up for astronomy i thought we would be learning a little bit about our horoscope signs but we did not but i still found the class interesting.
a lot of the time i feel uncomfortable im my regular stem classes because i feel that i may be the only one not understanding.
i did not have that great of a high school chemistry teacher so my knowledge in chem is very minimal.
i consider myself that i prefer to stay with someone not being alone.
i wished that i was more interested in the math and maybe i would not dislike the subject overall because when i saw that physics was one of the classes i had to take i was not jumping of happiness but instead i crunch and put it off for the longest time.
i am here in this class because it is a prerequisite for my major which is biology (physiology).
i had taken classes here and there related to java and python and took a small interest in computer science.
i love how the extra problems and worksheets are helping me understand what we learn more.
i already have recognized that i wouldn't mind spending more time and dedication into being at school as long as i pursue higher education.
"first place i went was arizona, at there i finished my high school, also at there i got the first car in my life."
all of my classes are super stressful and i have the busiest schedule of my life.
i am taking physics 111 and 112 mostly to fulfill my general education requirement.
"i had only figured out what my major was 2 years into community college and although i'm not sure where i'm headed, i feel like i'm cultivating my path as i go."
working amongst scientists to find the causes and cures of diseases is my main career goal and i would love to have a job in which i would look forward to going to everyday.
i always or often ask myself that question everyday and in physics.
my goal is to be able to learn the things that i need to know for whatever future endeavors ill have and im hoping school could prepare me for that.
i plan on applying my full attention in class and going over the worksheets when i am home to further prepare me for my exam.
i am here because this is the path of my major here at san francisco state.
i look forward to spending every tuesday of this semester in your sci class.
the last reason is to be able to meet new people.
i do not enjoy physics and often question why i am here.
"then, the cell tower receives the electrical signal and sends it to the other side through the electromagnetic spectrum."
not only will i learn new things but my analytical skills will be sharpened and the way i approach a problem in finding a solution.
i do not think it will matter what the calculations are.
finding meaning to what you do bring enjoyment and clarity to your life because you aren't constantly asking why am i doing this or why am i here.
i come from a low income neighborhood that does not offer the best education.
"however, for my major, i would definitely need a degree because its smiled upon."
after this i will pursue medical school.
"the reason i bring up the chronological order of freshman year's events is because i developed an acute fondness for computer science and the field of programming. i absolutely love programming, and any concept related to it, but the other required courses such as physics were what have always troubled me."
i just want be here and be joyful.
"i really love animals, i hate it when i see them sick or hurt on the street and i cant do anything to help them at all."
and didn't just want to stay at home and basically throw my life away.
"honestly, im not too sure."
i feel like i will pass this lab with ease since i was able to pass the previous lab without a problem!
"thats a question everyone should ask themselves at least once, especially in college, when youre on the path to starting a career, to really starting the life youll lead maybe for the rest of our lives."
i am also here because i plan on majoring in bio with a concentration in zoology.
i am here because i think science is super interesting even though sometimes i don't feel that good at it.
i think i am here because for some reason i think that i was made to make a difference in the peoples lives around me to make their days better and just so they can have someone to be there for them.
i watched her spiral into a vicious cycle of depression and anxiety.
"i was able to live close to school, and if i am ever hungry or need supplies, i love how there are stores nearby."
"i do enjoy game design and creating games, but i also understand the difficulty so i am still considering other fields i can work in."
why am i here in this class?
"they were stressed out with work, school, and me."
these type of thoughts influence literally everything i do.
i am a kinesiology major and physics is one of the required classes to take.
throughout my entire life i have dreamt about working in the medical field.
i am all about learning and wanting to do better and better in all that i do and i know this course is perfect for that.
this will also force me to review material taught in class instead of cramming all the material a day before an exam.
i'm here in class because we had a quiz and angela doesn't make this class too bad either.
"on a broader note, i think about why i am in college in the first place."
why are there so many equations for us to memorize..
i tried taking this class last semester but i was under a lot of stress because i was retaking a chemistry class that i had failed.
it was truly a passion of mine.
"my reason is pretty simple, but i can talk about the class so far its really cool."
i came up here because i wanted to have a new start in a different environment.
this class is like a required study session that i get credit for.
i love seeing how things i learned in trigonometry and calculus applied more to the physic aspect and how it is relevant to our everyday situations.
i also hope to review test topics before an exam to make sure i know all that i should know which would be on the test.
"i originally planned on letting myself have time to attend office hours, but i realized that wouldnt be enough."
this is my first semester in sf state coming from community college.
its much easier to understand concepts this way.
"how did i get here?ithink this class will be very informative as it will help me understand the world better, and that will in turn help me better understand who i am."
it will be a hospital.
"to be honest i still don't know why i am here or what my purpose in life is but i am only 21, i don't think i'm suppose to know yet."
looking forwards to a great and productive semester.
i passed the class and enrolled into physics 121 and 122 to complete my pathway to continue on to earn my biochemistry degree in the future.
i am also terrible at understanding the conceptual components that physics presents.
"ive always wanted to be a doctor ,even as a child."
so far its looking good.
something we would not be able to do if we were just looking at a piece of paper.
"then i came to realization that biology was the perfect major for me, even if i wasn't gonna make as much money doing it."
i want to be able to have financial stability for the future and to not have my family ever worry about having enough money to pay the bills.
they truly went above and beyond with helping us know that we were in fact ready to take on anything this course had to throw at us.
"hopefully taking all these integrated math classes for my major, i can be very wellrounded in math, although it takes me a while to compute problems, at least the answers will be right."
"i know physics is very math heavy and conceptually confusing, so i knew sci would be perfect for me this semester."
"but either way, i'm here to give my effort and commit to understanding whatever we are learning."
"i actually took the astronomy lecture about 3 years ago, so much of the information i learn in this lab are very distant from my memory."
i cant afford to take this time for granted.
this class will definitely help me get a good grade chem 115 which is my goal this year
im very grateful for this opportunity.
although school is sadly online i can already tell this class will be a lot of fun!
"throughout the semester, i have gone through almost a month changing into this major, while i had many frustrations with time and juggling multiple other assignments, i still feel very happy to explain and share the things i learned in this class to my other friends and such."
i think that doctors should all be well adverse in areas so that they can guide their patients and also to provide the best health care.
i am here studying computer science.
another reason why i took this class is to meet new people as it good thing to make more friends.
im hoping that being in this class will help me learn more concepts of studying and learning.
i think physics is important and can be seen throughout someones day.
"i think electricity and magnetism is often overlooked even in todays technological age because its on such a small scale, and i think its amazing how we are able to utilize something we cannot directly touch and see."
i do value the importance of math and sciene but understanding it is much more difficult.
there aren't very many competitive things for me to do except video games which i am bored of now.
the reason why i say that is because last semester i enrolled in physics only to be lost on the first day of class.
"i know that this job i may not be able to save all of them, or i may have to be the one who puts them down."
"my goal is to graduate in four years and in order to do that i have to sacrifice my mornings, so that i could take my classes early and have more time in the afternoon to either work or get more classes to take."
i believe that education is best gained by practical experience.
i am international student and i come from china.
reasons that pertain only to me and other reasons that pertain to my family or other loved ones.
that is just part of the reason why i am here.
i'm here because of my parent's will to have a child and pass on life.
"all in all, i am here because it is a pre requisite but i also enjo y the ext ra knowledge to further enhance my brain."
this class was chance for me to 'doubleback' and practice more on perfecting my craft.
this class also will help the structure of the procedure of logical problem solving which is important for my major.
i take it concurrently with the astronomy class taught by chris mccarthy.
"additionally, i am hopeful that learning from classmates that are of more senior standing than myself could give me some insight on some of the teachers to target or avoid, and answer some of the other questions i have about my future endeavors."
with financial stability comes less stress and worry.
being the youngest of 4 and all of my older sibling having college degrees has helped me get through the challenges in school and life.
"when reflecting on the question of why i am here, what first comes to mind is my intention to build upon my learning and knowledge."
this will be one of my last lower division classes so that i can focus on more of my upper division classes.
answering why i am here is a question that can be taken from different angles.
"phys 232 seems quite interesting, seems like i am going to get electric shock by the end of the semester."
i do believe knowledge is power and amazing things can be done with the right knowledge.
i am here so that i can learn about physics.
"but as the school year went on, i discovered things about college and about myself and thought, maybe theres more to just going to class and taking naps. that was my thinking for the first semester of my freshmen year here at sf state."
i am here for only a few reasons.
i am currently taking calc 228 and i have struggled with math throughout my education experience so the more practice the better.
i love animals and i am 100 sure i want to spend the rest of my life helping them.
it feels like we don't know our purpose or why we are here until our final moments when we reflect on our past.
"i'm hoping its usefulness will become more apparent as i continue with my undergraduate studies, but for now, i'm just taking this class because the school says i have to."
it takes awhile for someone to realize their true purpose or potential but in the end it took one newspaper to convince me that earth's environment and every other planet is just as important as understanding why you are here and what makes you different mentally and physically amongst possible civilizations out there as well as what you can offer to the world.
"i was always getting bad grades, kicked out of schools, and doing things that i shouldn't have been doing."
i am very nervous cause i constantly wonder if i chose the right major or not.
my major is biochemistry.
i hope to pass this class and move on and never look back and take another physics class.
yesterday i went and talked to my lab instructor about a homework problem and then i talked to professor lacy about it.
and now i am out of my words.
i actually really have been enjoying physics.
"however, with the difficulties the world is currently facing i have decided that taking this class is the best decision right now."
"i always have a why question after i learn something about our universe, like even if i learn the fact and the why it is the way it is, i'm still like ok but why, i don't know if that makes sense but it's just how trippy it gets me."
this is a good opportunity for me to refresh my memories of what i learned since high school physics class.
"in the future i hope to be able to provide my children, nieces, and nephews the ability to get an education in a competitive field so that they can have success as well."
i have taken physics in high school and i found it fun and annoying at the same time.
"sci class is like a formal study group where we do review activities, such as kahoot or mock exams, and i enjoy everything about it."
"i hope that even if i end up missing lecture classes, that i can attend this supplemental course and make up that loss time."
"in taking a physics class which has never been my best subject, but i always want to try my best in understanding the concept so i can do good my test and exams."
"in other words, this class will help teach me about the process on how to get an answer and analyze not only the answer, but the same process as well, to make sure i fully understand everything."
having heard form other students that calculus two is the hardest of the three calculus courses i feel more comfortable taking the course knowing that i can come to this class and practice the skills and concepts we learn in lecture.
i have class during my professors office hours and i tend to suffer in silence and try to figure it out myself when im confused about topics.
i am here in this physics class because i need it to fill a major requirement but i am also in this class to learn as much as i can.
"also, the genentech scholars program that im currently in recommended us to take sci courses, so here i am."
"""why am i here"", the reason why i am here taking this class is because i need to take this class as a requirement for my major which is construction management."
im originally from san bernardino california and now that im in san francisco state university.
"in order to become a licensed psychologist, i need to graduate from a university first."
you meet great instructors that are positive and want everyone to learn and have a good grip on the concept in order to be confident when taking a quiz or exam.
the main reason that i enrolled into the physics lab was because my major required me to pass the course.
"im a big advocate for having properaccurate representation, especially in media."
how i treat others is how i expect others to treat me.
i no longer hate math or physics and i have learned to cope with them.
my sleep is pretty wack.
my community help me to understand chem so thank you!
i feel like this will force me to review physics concepts in a timely manner instead of cramming everything taught night before.
the first time i was exposed to this field of study was in 8th grade science class which included a section of astronomy and it was a blast.
i am here taking this course because it is a requirement for my major.
"math has its own charm, so does physics."
not necessarily sure.
i am here at san francisco state to get by bachelors degree in general biology.
i am here taking a physics class to learn how the world works because many of us don't realize that physics is all around the universe.
i am a biology major with an emphasis in physiology.
i am not too sure what i am doing in terms of life stuff.
i'm really bad at math and prone to making small math mistakes which makes problemsolving very frustrating!
i hope that you will accept it
it really scares me.
i took the physics and the bio lecture.
i am here in this physics class to finish my undergrad major requirements.
what can i do to change the world?
even though my major does not have much to do with physics i still think ill end up finding this course quit interesting.
because physics one of the subjects that help us know what happen around us.
"although i changed my direction career wise, i am asked to this day by students to act in their films and script readings at sfsu. it has been nice to find a balance in my hobbies and career goals this semester; the unexamined life is not worth living."
"however, it on the other hand can help me understand the concepts and relate them to my everyday life."
i am taking this sci 215 class because i feel that it would be great to receive more assistance in understanding the concepts taught in the lectures.
i took astronomy class theory but i wanna see how could i apply theory to this class.
"i love the culture, style, busyness, etc."
he considered the problem from principles and then he found the solution to make inexpensive rockets.
i have noticed since taking a statistics class that it has a lot of it included in the subject and a little of calculus.
"if you ask me why am i here at sfsu, i can immediately tell that because i love this school."
i dont have much faith in politics or world rulers and certainly dont see anyone in politics making real change that makes peoples lives better.
i know if i didn't get any tutoring or supplemental learning i'd probably fail.
i make small mistakes and i did not even know it until my work was graded.
"in addition to getting extra help on the bio 230 course, i'm also able to meet new people and have study groups for exams coming up this semester."
"i don't want to be here in the sense that i wanted to be in another lab but there is, unfortunately, no room for me in there."
i've always been curious about the stars anyway so to me it just made sense to take astronomy as my class with a lab.
"therefore, ive chosen to go to college to enhance my knowledge."
the reason i came to sf state is because i wante to be in a new environment away from where i'm from (la).
i really believe in a lot of the teachings in the faith and it is important for me to follow these things and also important for me to show other people.
so this is halfway through my ba
"although you can do that outside of school, its also good to do it inside."
the reason why i am in this class is because of how i know that this will assist me in reaching my goal.
"i am taking physics 230232 because it is one of my lowerdivision major class, this class will help me expand my learning, daily life, and especially how physics is connected to our everyday life."
"i just want to be someone others can count on, because in my darkest moments i have felt so alone."
she claimed it was ridiculously hard and that it almost caused her not to graduate as a student.
i have always been curious about the stars and universe.
i think i am just the sum of all these random chances and probabilities.
"although that is why i am taking the class, i have great interest in learning physics, and would take modern physics if i had the opportunity."
it seems like they would not be because they are all different subjects but all of science is connected.
"i knew physics one of the hardest subjects, but i will push my self as much as i can to get better understanding of the material, we will study in the class."
sports have always been a big part of my life ever since i was in elementary school and i have played in a couple basketball leagues growing up.
"""why am i here?"" is a question i ask myself everyday."
or i could say that i am here because i chose to stay alive.
i am already four weeks into the class and it is not as bad as i thought it would be.
this lab section was also the one that fit most well into my schedule.
"i went from wanting to be a civil engineer meaning taking a lot of math classes, physics classes and as well as hands on classes to adhere to my experience but in the end i didn't like it."
i did not realize that the physics also had a lab class that goes along with it until i saw the road map from the biochemistry department.
i took general physics 1 and i was confused on how it related to my goals.
i would also like to use the experience ive gained with that degree to take the cpa a exam and become a cpa auditor.
why i am here i am here in san francisco state because i need to get my education.
"now i'm in comm, asian american studies, and political science classes and i feel more purposeful not only at the school but in the city."
there are a bunch of experimentals from this lab class.
its makes everything so simple and keeps everything very objective.
the class was small and everyone got along with each other.
"i do not feel smart enough for this class especially when my teachers expect me to know this information automatically, which discourages me even more."
it sounds clich but it really is the truth.
i feel that they deserve this as much as me or even more.
"however, the more invested i became in my future career the more i noticed that physics plays a significant part especially when i took biomechanics."
i regret taking a class that starts at 6 pm.
i'm very impressive with learning moon phases.
"that is what i believe the purpose of humanity is, to have the potential to change and ultimately live up to that potential is probably the most important thing anyone can do."
so it's a win win for me if i pass this class.
"every subject within science that i have taken so far(bio, genetics, chemistry), i found very fun and interesting so i am excited about this physics class!"
if i struggle i will gladly ask for assistance because it will make the biggest difference.
physics is in everyday life so this class will come in handy.
i took this class last semester with haji and i ended up with a d.
this global pandemic has been a huge influence in to where i am right now and i really wish that i was back in san francisco learning back on campus even with all the major wildfires happening in california right now.
being in school is my start towards success.
i used to be good at math and stuff not so much anymore i'm pretty average at it and thats cool.
"physics is hard because it contains math and so much more, but i have been told that that is the fun part of it."
many think that but i think otherwise.
also i knew a couple people who were attending this school already and that swayed me to come here.
"however, at that time, i rarely performed physics experiments."
this class seemed the most interesting to me and for that reason i chose to take it.
i am here in this class because i need more help on chem 115.
i need to take phys 112 and more phys after that.
this is one of the reasons why i am taking the intro physics class this summer.
i also want to work with athletes because i love being in a sports environment because its very fast pace and my everyday would always be interesting
this will be a good chance to practice doing all the work without a calculator.
i am in this course because it is a required course.
at the same time i would improve my foundation of the work that i would have to do in the future.
this is the only physics class i have to take in my major.
"i feel in being part here, i'm also preparing for my future and preparing for my selfworth."
i just have my own way of doing things.
i was a little confused why id be answering that in a physics class.
i decided to enroll in this 1 unit course as a sort of precautionary measure.
it also helps to further understanding about how the world works around us and connects with both chemistry and biology.
"additionally, i believe everything happens for a reason (in an atheist approach) and i was brought to the city to be able to discover different elements of my own changing character."
"how we discovered when planets seem to move backwards, calling it retrograde motion."
the reason why i am here is because my major requires me to take this physics to continue my education.
"my thoughts on why im here as in my physical existence, is a question i have always had (as im sure lots of others have asked themselves at one point in their lives), but i never went further than asking myself that question and wondering why."
it's within our dna to be scared as a defense mechanism.
i'm not too upset i have to take this class because it does seem really interesting!
to spread what i learned from coming to a university and teaching it to them.
"more broadly, i am here because im excited to get an education."
im in this field first of all because i fell in love with astronomy.
i barely managed to pass high school physics and i felt i learned nothing.
"hello my name is merim,i am in this physics class because i am a biology major and need this class a pre requisite for my studies."
"i feel that in the side class is a good class for me to do more example question in there, to more understand the topic and working together which is good for me to work on better than doing without myself."
"i want them to see me working hard to achieve my goals, so they do the same."
there can be a great disconnect from the things we learn in class to the real world.
and the webassign is bullshit.
such as getting onto an airplane and for takeoff.
"honestly, i did not look forward to taking the physics classes, but the professors seem cool, and they can teach."
veterinary schools are extremely competitive and only students with high gpas and hundreds of hours of animalveterinary experience are admitted.
how did he learn how to think?
"it takes two hours to travel from home to sfsu. and on wednesdays, my class starts at 9 am and ends at 9 pm."
most of my friends and family are here as well.
im really excited to be taking physics for the first time and see what i learn.
why am i here?i am here because i decided that education is important to me.
i do not want this class to just be a prerequisite to other courses in my major; i would genuinely like to have an understanding of what is taking place and how i can apply that knowledge to other areas in my major.
how can one know why they are here?
the lecture is only twice a week and our professor talks really fast and i sometimes miss the point and its also easier to understand when a classmate or a group is doing the work with you and actually helping you figure it out.
there is a purpose to each class i take and even the fact that i have switched lab sections to be in this specific class.
"as a general biology major, taking this course is very important so that i can learn more skills in physics, have a better understanding the science of physics and how it affects our surroundings on earth."
as i mentioned earlier im here because i need to take physics in as a course for my kinesiology degree.
i lose myself quite often....
i am going to turn 21 in 4 days.
"another reason, i choose to be here in this school because luckily my financial aid (fafsa) package was able to fully pay my tuition."
"i took physics in high school and was absolutely in love, but as we all know high school courses are not the same as college courses."
"what happens to us when we pass away yes, our body decomposes but what happens to our conscious state?"
i believe i'm here to better my understanding of physics so it will benefit me in the career i am studying for.
i am here because i want to further my understanding in my calculus class.
i am here because i am happy to be living and enjoy the roller coster of life.
i am hoping that the following classes until the end of the semester are more understanding and beneficial to my needs.
i think that people do not realize how much influence they have on living things around them.
and then in the side class i think i can easy to ask other people for the help since we rush in the morning class.
"during my high school senior year, my grandpa has passed away suddenly."
after my first year in sfsu i embraced living in san francisco and specially studying in this university.
i find the worldearth a very fascinating place and how things work and operate blows my mind.
going into this semester i thought i would do really well in physics and struggle in calculus.
"keeping an open mind i am looking forward to this transition and know it will be difficult but after the military nothing really can be that bad, or can it? expectations for this class are high i suppose in the fact that this course takes prerequisites to even get into."
"finally, i hope i can do well in this class."
i love to know how the way stuff works in the world and make new technological advancements.
"i dont know if its only here in the bay area that we just have really good experiences when it comes to learning with the american education system, but i know i am grateful with the opportunities the professors are able to offer during this hard period."
hopefully in the future i will be able to get into a masters program and be able to do what i want.
a physics lab helps a student in learning the importance of the theory.
our lecture class doesn't do that or maybe i'm just having trouble understanding the lecture.
"while im here i can obtain a lot of useful ideas, some i can apply to my day to day life."
im interested in chemistry and physics a lot.
"after sfsu, i plan on taking a year to catch up on all my requirements and also get more hands on experience."
i don't have any particular passion for physics but it is useful for my every day life and i need it for my degree.
i signed up for this class because i wanted to have the best resources available to study for bio 230.
i believe getting an education at san francisco state is unique and can benefit me in the future.
now i'm here and am using sci resources to get better in ochem
"i have never studied astronomy before and i figured it would be interesting, which it is."
i am also a mother of 2 who i want to set a good example for and that hard work does and will pay o.
the main reason that i decided to enroll in this class is to fulfill a requirement for my biology major.
these are some of the reason i want to be in this class.
"the main reason i am in this class is because my major, microbiology, requires me to take this course."
"the constellation, different star patterns, and learning about how many stars are actually in the solar system."
"at that time, nasa ordered parts of rocket to company and it accepted the price which company showed."
"you may not know that i am a person who partial on science, my liberal arts is not that good."
"while i am almost 22, i am just becoming what i call a real adult."
she always told me that you had to study more so you wont get the same path as she did in the past.
"this is a popular belief, but not derived from logic."
"i always work around computers, but when thinking about mechanics going more in depth than that is just crazy to me."
to be completely honest i am taking this course to further my progression in my major.
"since my major is prebiochemistry, taking this class will assist me in my completing one of my major classes required for me to graduate."
how does anyone ever know for sure?
the reason for me being in the class is to understand the different mechanics of the world and learn from it.
its a requirement for my major and im not trying to fall behind.
one example that is working in villages in places like mexico to make an efficient electric grid.
sorry i came late today and i have a slow computer so this might be a short journal.
"teachers make the difference, and my high school honors chem instructor made the subject challenging."
why am i here in sci 111?
"i believe that i can make something out of an artistic field and a scientific field, bringing something new to the table, i just do not know what that would be yet."
i also think this class is a good opportunity to create study groups and make new friends in my major.
"i know that i want a career in which ill help people, but im still not completely sure if this is how i want to go about it."
"this course along with other are actually really important for me i take, this class is a designated class for my specific major."
"also, i am taking this physics lab as a requirement for the physics lecture."
i am here right now because attendance is mandatory and i cannot do the work if i am not in class.
"i am also here because it fits my current class schedule, sort of in the middle of it and it is just before the weekend."
my major is biology with a concentration in physiology and this major is a pathway towards my career goal.
i am here because i know i could use the extra help and it would really help solidify the concepts that i have learned in class.
"so far, i really enjoy this lab course because my lab professor does a great job in communicating with his students when there are any sorts of confusion in the lesson."
"after all, it's who you know, not what you know."
i have taken conceptual physics last semester and i really enjoyed the class.
i also wanted to note that im glad to even get this class.
it brings me clarity in the mind of the basic concept of physics and helps me to understand and memorize.
i also enrolled in sci 111 to get further practice.
"i have graduated undergrad and completed my physics prerequisites already, but because i completed them abroad in europe, the credits are not valid for admission into u.s. m.d. medical schools, therefore i must use this opportunity in my postbac program to revisit these courses and do the best i can before the upcoming application cycles."
listening to what they were study seemed interesting and to learn about the law of physics was in intriguing.
"learning in this new format is difficult as to me personally, and i think a lot of people agree with this, which is that having that in person experience and hands on experience with learning is needed to further improve your own learning."
looking back on my decision i wish i would've stuck with physics and done chemistry a different semester.
i wanted to know the outcome of my patients.
explains how things work and pretty much in my eyes how why it works through math.
this is why i am here and i am glad that i am.
i strongly believe that we are all here for a reason and finding your purpose is what life is.
i am at sfsu because i wanted to run cross country in college.
it is a very much needed course for my major.
i strive to be knowledgeable and wellrounded so any opportunity to expand that is greatly appreciated.
"during my sophomore year here at sfsu, i was just as confused as when i came in and decided to declare business because everyone around me said it would be a good idea because you can do a lot with it."
"i guess since then, i've forgotten how intriguing this whole field of study was and the reason i keep coming to this lab is because it's fun and interesting, though i wish i wasn't as long as it is; i realize though why that is."
thats why i am here.
chris seng reflective journal 1 i am here because as a stem major i need a certain amount of units from the calculus and physics section in order to graduate.
this class is a requirement to helping me move forward in my career path.
some topics of physics will help me through life because in life there is physics.
why am i here in stem?
"im here to learn what ive been trying to avoid learning, but enjoy it so far."
"i took physics in high school, but i can't recall much of it so me being here will give me a better understanding of how physics works."
first to create a meaningful and wonderful personal life that can be shared with another human.
"therefor, this revisit of the course allows me to step back and learn the topic better in time for the mcat where i will need these skills."
"i am a computer science major which involves a lot of math, and phys 220 is the first science class that is required to be taken and it comes with a lab as well."
"as to why i'm in this specific section, it is simply because it fits the best with my schedule."
"i dont believe i have any higher purpose and that im only here because of chance and the odds being in my favor. if by here, however, you mean to ask why im in this class, its because i have to be."
i think everyone was a little lost in my class.
i dont know if this question ponders why we are alive today in this world or why we are in this class.
"back then, i only learned about the conceptual physics and i often gave up when i encountered a word problem that was too hard."
"in the lecture, there is no homework or quizzes so that is a major part of the grade that is not going to be added because it is just based on the exams."
i intend to finish this physics class and continue on to the second semester physics to complete my requirements and move on to upper division courses within my major.
"and the idea of being free, and doing anything that i want is the main purpose of me being here."
what is my purpose?
im grateful to be going to such a good university with such caring professors.
"physics is interesting as many of the concepts are conceptual and people who are younger wouldnt really think much about how it works, but once you learn about things like energy and gravity, it opens up so much knowledge and things to discover."
only a few years ago almost everyone had begun carrying a smartphone with them.
"one, i have always been a techy!"
"overall, im here to focus on my future and have a positive influence on society."
i am taking sci 234 to improve my skills in physics 230.
"like understand velocity, acceleration and displacement to determine the motion of an object."
one is obviously this class is a requirement for my general education credits and also because i thought it'd be interesting to further my education on astronomy.
"i am going to die anyways, the only thing that moves most humans forward is the small things."
"i also had a year selling electronics parts (transistors, resistors those kinda things) at a local electronics store in costa mesa."
"but since there must be a purpose to needing to know physics in the eyes of the biology department, i will try my best to at least get a grasp of knowing what is going on."
"perhaps another reason is, it's important to know physics, so that we'd understand how things theoretically work."
"although i am not a physics major, i do take joy in telling others what i am learning in class."
"these two things are always exist in our life, but we are ignoring them every time they show up."
i am mainly here once a week trying to learn something new but mainly finish my general requirement.
i'm a firstgeneration university student so i'm mostly just grateful for the opportunity to study and see the world through so many different lenses.
"i entered college with extreme certainty that this is what i wanted to do and fortunately for me, this feeling has only been solidified."
maybe i actually don't fully understand the concepts?
"even though i lack motivation at the moment, i still would like to be a cardiothoracic surgeon someday but i feel like it is not my purpose."
so then i thought i could take textiles lab and that it would count for my ge requirements.
i am nervous about taking a physics courses because i have never taken one before.
"why i am herefor graduated, we need one science lab class."
this is why i am here.
i want the additional help so that i can better grasp the concepts being taught in lecture.
"yes, i will have to document my work, but i won't have to propose theories and preform experiments to determine the validity of my theories."
"even if i was not into computer science, my major would still be somewhere in the stem field, because i was always more interested in math and science than english and history."
i am attending this class to fulfill the prerequisites needed for my major.
peer learning is an effective way to expose the complicated concepts.
"and, the best place to know and explore physical science thing is this lab."
i had a pretty bad experience in the astronomy lecture in the fall of 2018.
it takes a lot of effort for me to study and work for this class because i have a short attention span with things im not fully interested in.
"financially thought, sfsu was what i could afford so i committed here."
its pretty interesting to understand the way things work.
why are you here?
this course is one of the prerequisite courses that i need to complete before taking any upper division science courses.
i know i have years ahead of me but this is a dream i will never stop chasing.
i spent my first two years of college getting prepped to go to nursing school and i had a realization i did not want to do that.
"as well as, vectors and their importance to the world of physics."
"for many of us here phys 111 is a required class for many biology majors, but i'm particularly interested in getting introduced to new topic."
hopefully finishing the course will allow me to be more open in science courses and be excited to learn some new things.
there are times i feel like an imposter in my classes.
my only hope is that i'll be able to pass this class and graduate smoothly.
"therefore the ability to be able to leave this class with a deeper understanding of the natural environment and my interactions with it are of the utmost importance to me, which is ultimately why i enrolled in sci 180."
leaving home and venturing out to attend college at san francisco state became something i wanted do once i was presented with how this route can lead me to success.
i have taken physics in high school and i am hoping it would be similar because it was fairly easy and fun.
i am enrolled here because it is apart of my pathway of life to lead me to my goals.
"yet there is a limit to being curious, as one should not go deeper to something dangerous."
i find it pretentious to think about it and self congratulatory and those who do view themselves better than others.
"im classroom setting, i cant help but feel invited to learn especially with individuals that are equally eager."
it amazes me on the stuffs in it as there's still many things that amaze me still.
"however, i don't really have a choice so i will just have to manage like everyone else."
"for this physics lab, i am taking this course to fulfill part of my lower general education requirements for my major, kinesiology, and for more units."
especially since i will be using physics in my everyday life it would be pretty important to me to learn it early and fully understand it rather than struggling in the future and trying to understand it while im at a job wouldnt really look too well on me.
i see it as an opportunity to learn by doing experiments.
"my intended major is civil engineering, i've been striving to be that since after high school, in which i went to a four year university."
these are the main reason i am here.
the stem field is very important because stem is by my side.
"in other words it seems life is just the test, and whatever is after life is the bigger picture."
"in addition, i find physics to be very interesting as it affects us in our every day life."
"its also hard to keep up with my lab partners because they have prior knowledge of taking the course before but, ive committed to putting in the extra effort to understand more about the labs by reading the summaries and reviewing them after to see what ive learned."
i didn't really think about the future.
i also hope that attending this course will broaden my conceptual comprehension of physics.
i joined sci 111 because i was in sci 230 and 240 and it did help me while i was both in biol 230 and 240.
there was a group of students in my chemistry 115 class inviting us to join a tutoring class that will give extra help for chemistry.
i am here because this class is required for my degree.
everywhere we look in the world we are surrounded by physics so it is important to understand.
"i know there is no perfect answer for it, we just have live this life to know why we are her and to what purpose we serve."
"in bio 240 i didnt had a great time because we learned about animals and insects and plants which is dry labs and are boring, so i hope this class is fun."
"i am here for, i'm not exactly sure anymore."
"as i got older and figured out what i wanted to study and do my life, i grew an interest for all science courses but especially physics since it's an everyday thing."
and i am also here typing this on my computer from home right now because of covid19.
overall i see my education as a gateway to help others in need.
"the way i interpret it as is, why am i here in the world today."
"to do so, i want as much exposure to the concepts as possible."
education is important to me.
"so for example this class, phys 230 232."
i took physics when i was in my freshman year of high school which was almost five years ago.
i would rather ensure i succeed in all my courses this semester so that i can graduate and get out fast.
my whole life i wanted to work with animals but as i grew up i realized that that isnt something ill be able to pursue because i have a weak stomach.
i recently transferred here after taking a break for two years due to a traumatic event.
everything is a process and learning process.
i was not able to attend the first lab session earlier in the semester which was the reason why i never got to submit this.
but on my own reason is that i cant survive in china society.
i still remember my experiences not taking sci when i was completing my bio 230 and 240 pathway and when i took sci for chem 115.
to make myself a better person and more knowledgeable
i am a rather spiritual person i would say and i am also a curious one and for that reason i've asked a lot of different people a lot of different questions.
"like most of my fellow classmate, we are all unfortunately forced to be contained in our homes instead of a normal learning environment."
"it is one thing to take physics but it is another to understand it, to know the material and how to apply it to the real world."
so i took this challenge and decided on studying mechanical engineering because i felt it is the only major i am interested in and feel is worth my time (pay off eventually).
i prefer labs more than lectures since i am able to move around and not be forced to sit still while some person talks at me.
even though im a biology major science is still very difficult for me.
"even though it terrifies me, i am still willing to learn physics."
"when i was younger, my sister introduced astrology to me, and i thought that astronomy was the exact same thing."
"but luckily botany doesnt really need math, cell research also doesnt need that much math as well."
"science can be applied to so many aspects of our lives, especially physics."
many things you see live in stem. i want to enter stem because the income of the stem profession is higher than in other normal professions.
this course actually excites me because it is not about the human body or random chemicals (i hate chemistry) it is material that i can compare and contrast to my every day life.
"however, because of our current situation right now having to take classes online, and having an asynchronous class, my struggles in physics is back."
"i still couldnt help but take a music related class every semester, whether it be an electronic music class, chord theory, or live performance bands."
i want to open my own practice in san francisco and to make people feel good about themselves.
why are we all here?
"however, that doesn't change the interest i have for physics."
"sci 230 is meant to help me achieve these goals and if i didn't take this supplemental course and i ended up finishing the semester with less than an a, i'll never forgive myself for not taking advantages of the opportunities provided for me."
"i am still dreading the difficulty of my upcoming classes, but i am ready for the challenge and hope to come out on the other side much smarter and ready to apply this knowledge for good."
i am required to take this class and many more other classes that also require labs.
"i took the class last semester and completely stumbled and failed because i didn't understand any of the concepts in the beginning, and gave up for the rest of the semester."
i want to obtain this degree to then attend a medical school and declare my field of specialty in paininternal medicine.
i love math and every subject that has math.
i cant sit in a class with more then 200 people and just raise my hand because i feel like id be the only one confused about what im asking while everyone gets it.
when i chose this major out of interest i didnt look into how challenging it is.
i went to bootcamp and then the next year started back at college in a cs program.
when we moved from guatemala to the united states all she wanted was for us to have a better future.
i can practice on writing lab reports and improve it.
i also came to sfsu because of the apparel design major and am really loving it and learning so much in this major.
"if i had the choice, i wouldnt be taking it given physics 2 is likely to be a net loss for my gpa given anything less than a straight a would be."
i always struggle with physics concepts so when this course was offered i was more than happy to sign up.
"i am here because i commute to school everyday from antioch, ca to further my education."
"i took the lecture last semester and i did just fine in that class, although it sucked that i had to finish that class online."
"it was hard for me to tell which constellation i was seeing in the sky, so i hope to get more practice using the night sky tool in future labs."
so that is what i am doing here.
later on anything with technology drove my interest.
helping others get motivated to learn satisfies me so much and it builds new friendships that have a strong base.
i didnt want to put myself through a course where the professor made physics (an already difficult subject) even more difficult.
i would want a job that has meaning and would benefit the world.
"i often ask myself this question, ""why am i here?"" and i start to think about all i have done to be here, how far i have come."
"i am here because as humans, we learned to be more present and to have direction in our lives."
i try to take a sci class every semester because i have trouble focusing and understanding the professor since it is more fast paced and the class is big so its hard to have that one on one.
words i never thought i'd hear.
i was impressed by this story.
i also hope this class best prepares me for the mcat. this class will help me understand physics and will help me in my future classes.
"i know that this different field of science will give another perspective of how i will see the world, the universe, and how everything works from force to gravity to energy and beyond."
this class is also important to be able to have the opportunity to get hands on with the material taught in the physics 121 lecture portion of the course.
i have carried these values with me through school.
"a one hour airplane trip back home, 7 hour drive."
i can also use this time to do the work i feel is more difficult.
"i am here, i guess to start initially with san francisco state because i had a change of plans in my major."
i would say these majors are considering ones of the hardest majors in universities.
"also, turns out im not good at analyzing people so i dont know what people are thinking or read the room well."
i think the reason goes beyond me though.
"so far, i'm having fun and learning a lot."
the surrounding is comfortable.
"i always think to myself all of the things that have happened to me since i moved to san francisco last year, good or bad, and all the new things i learned and how there was no way i would have done that back in san diego."
"to put it simply, she could not teac h if her life depended on it."
learning about that and being able to help another person life is success and providing for the community around.
maybe that is why many people in jail end up committing suicide?
so i guess im here for a grade is all.
my name is student name.
afterwards ill use my skills and knowledge to find a career that works more for me or that i enjoy more that still can support my financial needs.
i am here because i am trying to set out of the same routine of working 12 hours to sit by.
"every other field of study that i show interest in is laughable in the eyes of everyone i know, and i kind of feel like i'm stuck in science whether i like it or not."
you are able to find a common knowledge that is attainable because physicist in the past have studied this phenomenon for centuries and this course teaches a curriculum of that subject matter.
"currently, three of my classes are related to calculus and vectors and derivatives so practicing clac, in general, will help me in my physics class as well as my statics class."
it also allows us to experiment and understand our own trial and error.
"im happy that i get a chance to learn things in a new way, and that goes for all the courses im taking this semester."
scientists are always inventing new things and physics are able to help us to realize what things are done.
i will also seek help from my peers as they may know more about certain topics than i do and try to spend as much time as possible learning from them.
"which if i know myself well enough, it will allow me procrastinate less on the weekends over homework and study time for midterms."
this sci class will be the perfect opportunity for me to take advantage of that learning style.
math is also the easiest subject for me to understand since i practiced math problems a lot as a kid so i had an advantage over the other subjects im not as good as.
and taking care of environments and animals takes care of us because we are all affected by the animals and the affected environment.
im here to bring others ease.
i am here in physics 112 lab because it is a requirement for my major for microbiology.
"even though i am a secondyear political science major here in sfsu, learning about astronomy for a barea requirement has been very intriguing for me."
i also heard good things about the sci classes from people who took it last year and they said it really helped them understand physics more.
"i'm a biology major, and ill be taking the class that follows this one."
then i changed it to psychology because i wanted to take the easy route because i saw that one of my friends was also a psych major so i wanted to copy them.
i am here because i need lab credits and i have always been fascinated by astronomy.
"maybe that is why i am here, to at least provide a slight change to science, although it may not be a big one at least it is something i can contribute to the world."
i am here because i am motivated to try and be successful.
the reason that i decided to join the sci supplement course was to try to get a better understanding of the organic course and make sure that i am able to leave with knowledge.
"it hurts my head and eyes, not only that it is much harder to do online learning because i feel like i am pretty much teaching myself everything, as opposed to actually learning."
"also, another reason im here is because i didnt take this class last semester which i was supposed to take it last semester, but i didnt."
"i doubted if that was what i truly wanted, but after interning in an operating room over the summer in high school, my passion was solidified."
i believe i will be sent home for a month and then deployed again.
"as most know right now, the environment is pretty fucked."
i believe working in smaller groups and being able to actually give an opinion helps greatly as well only because theres not a bunch of people judging if you are wrong.
focusing on problems with a small amount of people feels more productive to me personally.
i think it is because i have a knack for problem solving and find science extremely interesting.
i wished i could have enrolled in prof.
"also, it takes care of the lab requirement for credit."
"i also want to test the waters so to say, with taking these courses and what they consist of."
"i believe that making connections, understanding one another and expanding our views is important."
"by doing it that way, i may be able to better understand the lecture or lab course because they relate to each and discuss similar concepts."
"and partially, i'm not sure why i'm here."
"so when i decide or feel that i am good at something i tend to cling to it; so this is me, clinging to something i feel i am good at, thus far at the least."
i think that i'm here to contribute to the lives of others for the general good.
but overall i have always been interested in the theory of quantum physics so hopefully one day i will be able to do field research to get a better grasp of how our universe works.
"recently, however, my motivation has been up and down, and i was ultimately thinking of switching majors."
i wanted to choose a school that was close to home.
i am in this class because i also chose to be in the class.
but maybe the reason why i am here is because i have a purpose.
im trying to go it alone.
"however, now i realized the importance of enrolling into the classes a little earlier."
my major is astrophysics and the reason i chose that major is because astronomy is only offered as a minor so astrophysics was the closest major to that.
"despite it being required, i am also here to learn just like for any of my other courses, whether they are required ge's or required for my major."
with physics i can explain why a ball drops when you let go or why it doesnt move if you do not touch it.
its essentially a larger study group that we have more handson review on what we are learning.
"maura concoran, my chem 100 professor, made the subject much easier through her explanations and through attending office hours."
the reason as to why i am here is simply because i needed help understanding some aspects of chemistry.
"i am in college because i like learning, and want a good job that pays enough where i don't have to work crazy hours at a job i absolutely hate just to stay alive."
"because i believe the other people who want to be teachers are often deferred from doing so, because of the low salary."
so i am here by choice.
"my instructors have great teaching methods like kahoot, warm ups, worksheets, etc. that help me remember and practice the material."
i want to stay in my community help educate those who are not as knowledgeable so that they make informed decisions.
"first, i did physics 220 which seemed a little easier in comparison to physics 230."
they take care of premature and critically ill babies.
i need more tools and resources to succeed in organic chemistry.
many people now have a stem education and careers.
i am here for a whole bunch of reasons.
"also, the biology lab class is helping to improve my lab skills."
"in high school, we were not offered a physics class."
will there be any handon project or all these all labs?
still waiting for the response.
i saw that this could bring the opportunity a balanced worklife in and out of the field.
it also gives me the chance to have the handson experience and apply and improve my knowledge and connect the dots between what i learned from lectures and what i learned from labs.
"anyways, ive always liked chemistry and i enjoy studying for it but its always a class that you need to put in the work to get good grades."
"lubat asadovafebruary 21, 2020reflective journal 1 i enrolled in sci 220 for multiple reasons."
"science has always intrigued me, but i feel like the schooling system of stem classes kind of makes it harder for me to enjoy."
i plan on continuing by going to dental school and becoming a dentist.
i am grateful that physics is required because it allows me to have a deeper understanding of how the everyday experiences works.
if i show up to my classes there is a greater likelihood where i pass my classes if i show up.
i don't really like thinking about that question but i'm happy and i love the people in my life right now.
"but, why am i here?"
"if it is a general question, id say im here to learn more about the things i am curious about."
i sometimes wonder if ill live here forever or if i will move somewhere else.
i know for this class all this information even though i have a hard time grasping the information will help me succeed in the future.
"i'm pretty confident in my skills in chemistry currently, but i hope that by the end of the semester i will gain more confidence and not be afraid to ask questions and make errors."
all of the choices ive made is bringing me to a higher purpose that i know is waiting for me at the end.
my motivation lies in this city as for i dont think i could ever not live here.
one thing that routed me to that career field was being involved with sports my whole life up until high school.
i think im here because im suppose to make a impact no matter how big or small on the people i come to interact with.
no other science caught my attention as much as astronomy has.
so far the school has been good to me other than the fact that all of my first exams fall on the same week.
i then started building plastic model kits and eventually began to work on real cars.
"so i went into college with wanting to be a astrophysicist but i was also really interested in actually making devices and not all just theory and teaching, i decided to switch my major to mechanical engineering and really enjoyed it, so i never looked back again."
why am i here in this sci 111 course?
it seems that the professors are planning to make us the new einstein.
"i dont know where my life and passion for learning will take me, but it is exciting."
"however, the reality is that the field of physics is quite versatile because its a mixture of using our knowledgecommon sense with new information to solve a question."
i am also here because i heard you were a great teacher from some of my friends.
"i also like the fact that i can ask the sci instructors questions about chem 115 material, questions regarding calculations, alex homework, and upcoming exam material."
i took physics during the summer and i learned a lot in the little bit of time i had.
"this course also serves as a study session for me which forces me, in a way, to actually learn in a structured environment rather than on my own."
i am simply there to have more guidance and practice on the material taught to me in my chemistry class.
a vast majority of what we plan to study in this class has nothing to do with my reason for being here in general.
through lectures so far and in the lab i have covered a lot of material i did not know of.
"in terms of sf state, or studying cinema here at sf state, i would say im here because i have a passion for film and i want a college education to help me in my future aspirations."
"when i am in that room, i feel comfortable to ask my questions without having anyone judge me because i did not understand a topic that was taught by my professor."
being a chemistry major isnt the easiest thing when i have to take calculus based physics on the side.
"physic has always been the one subject i find so interesting and yet i have always been avoiding taking in, since it was not a needed course for my previous major."
"in college, i find joy in taking new biology courses and learning new things that i didnt know before."
i am not very good at physics it has never been my strong suit and the idea that i have simply made it this far demonstrate to me that i can do this.
"to have that degree i need to learn physics, and use it once i have learned it."
growing up i wanted to be in the stem field.
i also took astronomy 115 last semester and received a decent grade on it so i thought this class wouldn't be too bad.
"i think about the way i want to be here, for instance to spread happiness and love."
the reason why i am here is to learn the fundamentals and ethnics of physics and apply what i learned in the future for any possible reason that requires the knowledge of physics.
but as it turned out it was one of the best things to happen to me.
i hope i would like a lot from this class.
"the same could be said for everyone else who has contributed to me, whether it was for my emotional health well being, physical health, a good laugh, time that was specifically for me, food, etc."
i know that everything i learn will make me more round and capable to be more prepared for what's ahead.
"i believe that this physics course drastically contributes to my knowledge of physics, which i will apply in my engineering career."
"in cell biology, i look forward to learning about cellular and molecular mechanisms and apply my knowledge in the laboratory, participating in research opportunities to cement myself as a formidable force in science."
i am in the course to get more help with understanding the concept and formulas of physics because the first class was very confusing and my professor teaches very fast.
i learned that change is adaptable
"however, that does not mean that i do not want an a. last semester, i recall doing an essay like this."
this semester i am excited to challenge myself especially because this is the first time i am ever learning anything about physics.
i'm enrolled in the chem 215 sci course for several reasons.
why am i here...
"ultimately, i hope to get out as much as i can from my education in order to give back in the near future."
holly enrile physics lab reection1 sept.
"i wonder how this pressure has affected my development, and in what ways (if any) do i plan to fulfill these generational wishes."
i am a here at sfsu as a transfer student majoring in biochemistry.
"and these could probably tell why im (enroll) in this class, its to prepare my future self."
"for this class, i am trying to make friendsconnection with people who are trying to follow the same path."
"i did take astr 115 during my first semester of college last year, and having the opportunity to take a laboratory course designed for it is something that i find very unique and interesting."
that mars is made out of?
i would want that for myself as well.
"i also feel compelled to diversify the field of science with more women, since it is predominantly men."
i don't really know how in depth i supposed to go.
"so far i love the idea of california, the idea that people are open and accepting here."
so i am in your course to learn more about physics and i need this course for my major biochemistry.
so i decided to make my own clothesline but the design of my backyard didn't allow me for a simple line nail to the wall.
i dont even know what my passion is.
it is my first semester in my major as a third year.
"even if i'm taking this class just because of my major, i'd say i'm here because i am interested in physics and what i'll get out of it."
"another reason i like physics relates to the reason why i decided to do physics can better relate to a quote i once heard; to truly understand beauty is to be able to understand how the smallest part like neutrons, electrons, and even the quantum world works."
i'm here because i'm fighting my hardest at every step and its never enough so now i'm doing even more.
"she got her degree from university of california, berkeley."
finding your purpose is just as important as breathing.
"hello, this is rim hussein alazzani."
i tried to ask my advisor if i can get excuse from this course.
"for example, how can the ball move from point a to point b in how many time, or the experiment i did in high school that was we threw a water balloon from ceiling to the floor and could see the radius."
only for the purpose that some the information would stay more relevant in my head rather than only in the beginning of the week.
we dont really focus on that though.
i am in this class because it was part of the prerequisite and concurrent enrollment in physic 111.
growing up was pretty hard and the root of the problems are started from the lack of money.
"i gained my residency in california, allowing me to go to college."
i suppose im taking this physics course so that i can expand my general physics knowledge to see if i can apply physics concepts in my future research work.
this will strengthen my knowledge of physics so i can use it for the lecture portion and it helps me better understand calculus.
"higher education for me is a segway into the job field, without it would make getting a job in the future that much more difficult."
or maybe other ecological processes?
"but i know this class is essential for my learning because physics is implied in everyday life and necessary to understand applications, especially those in the medical field."
i am here because physics is a pre requisite for applying to physical therapy school.
but society doesn't let you do that.
"it is very fascinating to see for example, a light feather and a coin fall at the same speed in vacuum which seems very strange."
going into freshman year i was unsure about what kind of degree i wanted to pursue.
"honestly, sometimes i don't really know what i'm doing at college."
honestly that's what i define it as.
in a less broad sense why am i here in this class and in college?
that is what i am in school for but it is not going so well.
"i get so carried away from this, because it's so easy to get distracted in this world."
i've thought a lot about this subject to the point where i know too many different possibilities that it can drown me.
ive enjoyed all of my sci courses and all in all just college too.
a degree will allow you to chose from a multitude of pathways rather than just being presented with like 2 or 3 options.
i'm here because i should be able to relate the material being taught in lecture to understand how it applies to the real world as lab should do.
my intelligence is always questioned anywhere i go or any class i'm in so it's hard to stay motivated or drive to succeed because you feel like you're not enough.
"it was not always as apparent to me what the purpose of education was in high school, i felt like learning in high school was a little mechanical, and about moving through the motions."
the future of technology is very bright and i can see it continuing to evolve as time goes on.
taking this class along with the lecture and lab is my first big step into the world of biology as i haven't taken a biology related course since early high school.
"after graduating from oceana high school, i decided to work parttime and go to school parttime at city college of san francisco."
maybe its the american dream or whatever everyone else is doing so everyone just followers each other.
i still think physics is awesome because its a lot easier for me to comprehend and explain problems with real life situations.
taking this class will hopefully open myself up to asking question and pursuing help with my questions.
"(i got an a in the lab) while my teacher was very smart, she was new to teaching and i think she was very bad at it."
i'm hoping that i would need to use this class material in the future because i would later forget it over time if it's not constantly brought up throughout my life.
these invention are sole foundation and primary purpose to know about electricity and magnetism; also other physical science related things.
i chose this career because i have always wanted to do research.
"i am here, in sfsu taking science courses for many reasons.first and foremost, as an environmental science major, i am studying ti because i have always felt a close connection to nature, and seeing as the older generations are doing nothing to save it, i feel it is our generation's responsibility to step up and fight climate change."
"really wish we could be in person because i am a handson learner, so i like actually like doing the experiments."
i chose sfsu because it is a new school in a new city and i thoroughly enjoy meeting new people.
i am hoping that this lab will give me a steady foundation for learning physics.
"mothernature's meaning of life is, life or death."
"i want a good foundation in biology so that when i get to more advanced topics, i will have a better understanding(unlike some of my other classes like math)."
"i responded, ""um..."
it is always changing and we are always discovering new things.
knowing myself i know i will need to pass those exams to get the grade i want in than class.
"now a more general and relatable answer to the question why am i here (lets pretend this isnt a pandemic and this is a normal semester in sf), i am here at sfsu because i fell in love with the amazing crowded clouded city of san francisco and to me it is amazing and i love it."
being able to solve problems together and be able to understand the material that we are learning together helps me feel better about how i am doing.
"well yeah, that's pretty much it that's why i'm taking this class."
this is still growing in the united states.
overall i think improving my math skills and derivative skills will be a really important skill for me in the future.
"not so much, because i did not have the best teacher my first semester and it was quite challenging for me."
i really want to be a nurse in my future and i was to show the goodness in my heart to others and show them that i am there to help them.
i am excited to study what makes the physical world work and cant wait for this class to shed some insight into how the physical world around me.
i am not planning on majoring in physic or go into more details physic ideas.
i guess im just here to try and set myself up for success and live a relatively comfortable life.
"one of the greatest scientists, einstein, says, the most important thing is not to stop questioning. as he mentioned, physics give us a tool to have questions for everything."
but now i think i am here to learn something important that i can use for the rest of my life.
its actually a question i ask myself more often than i realized.
im 'non math et scientia et praecipue bonum est mihi in infirmitatibus meis duas maximus.
i am mainly interested in working on cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.
"second, i see this as an opportunity to make myself marketable for my entire working career."
"i said i was there to cover the ge. he gave me a borderline disgusted look and asked, ""so.."
"in lab, we do many experiments which involves real life examples and scenarios which can explain how things works around us."
i am here because i am working hard to make something of myself.
having that full enrollment status is important to me because i need the full financial support.
when i first started college however i struggled a lot and eventually dropped out.
"especially when clearing up confusions and things that were not understood in lecture, i believe sci is where that can happen and those skills can be enhanced with that additional hour and a half devoted to group study."
"even in school, i tried to be involved with stem related activities because it had always interested me."
"when taking bio courses, i heard that it could be hard to not only retain the information but be able to fully grasp the concept of the material due to the fact that so much new information is given to you in short amounts of time."
natalie aguirre astro 11602 why am i here why am i here?
hopefully taking them at the same time is actually beneficial and allows me to enhance my learning experiencing for both classes.
i hope that after taking this class i would be more confident in tackling physics problems and applying it further in my field especially since i am interested in biomechanics.
i am taking biology classes because i am majoring in biology in physiology as a focus.
sf state is the only other school i got into other then whittier because of a transcript screw up at my high school.
the reason why i want to go into stem is because i am in love with science and the world around me.
journal why am i here i am a biology and environmental science student.
"i went into the stem field because i wanted to try it out, and then i realized that i kind of enjoyed math, which lead to me continuing to stay in the field."
i am in this class because ive always wondered how and why certain things work and why do they behave in the ways that they do.
we mostly just talk about planes and stars and universes.
i have never previously taken any physics course throughout high school and i find it essential to be in this class to have a better understanding in general and as a science major.
"i am in sci 111 so i can keep myself motivated to do better, improve, and gain a better understanding on what is going on in my physics class."
for all the years ive been her and enjoyed every moment of it.
i would say that my previous experience in physics was fairly good and understandable.
"i think it is absolutely incredible that all of us are living here on earth, with developed prefrontal cortices and complex lives, while the rest of the universe is infinite and even more complex than we even know."
"although i like the idea of learning online, i find it very helpful to learn at my own pace whether slower or faster at times."
"during high school, i took many advanced classes focused on science and math facing majors."
i do not want to fail.
"i don't want a b in bio 230, i want at minimum an a since this is a required course for applying to grad school."
"also, discover myself and what i want."
"i have some reservations and doubts about what we can do about these things but i know for sure i cannot effect change if i cant support myself where i currently live, in the bay area."
i have always valued my education and i think its definitely the most important thing in my life.
this is the majority of the reason i choose to go into the stem field.
"however, i also do not feel like i am struggling in chem 215, but i wanted to try something new and do much better in chemistry."
i am here in phys 121 and phys 122 lab to finish my requirement classes for my astronomy minor at san francisco state university.
i knew that i wanted to go into engineering but i didn't know which specific field until i entered college where i just chose mechanical engineering.
"but moving on to the topic of being places in the first place, why did i even wanna bego to san francisco state university in the first place, well first it was because my parents forced me to go to a four year university, and then i chose sf state because they had the major i wanted, which was biology with a concentration in physiology and i also wanted to go far, considering im originally from southern california."
"the phys 220 introduce me the principles and practice with class, and phys 222 let it become the data we can see and calculate."
"i originally was going to take biology, but after i took the biology lecture i was not very interested."
i needed 60 units to apply there as an upper division transfer.
i feel like the question why am i here? is a question so broad that no one knows what to write except that this is a prerequisite class that we have to take in order to be able to get into our future classes.
one being i love many topics.
why do i need a dentistry school?
these resources give students many options to excel in their school work.
"i think it is a challenging yet interesting class, since we discover the law in different things."
for right now i'm okay with knowing that those are some of the reasons why i am here.
with my knowledge i plan to help out others in whatever career path i decide to go through whether that be a physicians assistant or a physical therapist.
"after i pass this class, i hope to never have to do physics again."
because my major right now is computer science which is consider to be a tech focus degree.
"in the past sci classes that ive taken, helped me understand topics like chemistry that helped me pass the class with confidence."
"however, elon thought of why the rocket was so expensive."
"and to be honest, i am here because there is nothing else for me to do besides work, especially because of the whole pandemic situation that is going on, this helps to further progress my study, as well as help occupy my time."
"also, i've been granted the gift of imagination which allows me to write mini books, poems, and short stories, along with a long list of other talents."
"i enjoy physics and the labs that come with it, but i think i'll stick with cruising through this course and getting the a."
i see more 18 year olds and it just makes me feel that much older.
whether it would be in research or as a head of company.
"although i ama finance major, i find astronomy to be a very interesting subject."
the hardest part of physics so far has been finding out where to start on a problem.
i am worried things will get worse before they get better...
there are a lot of things that impacted or pushed me towards this route.
i always tell myself that the reason i am here and not home going to a community college is because i wanted to experience and learn new things so bad.
"however, i have never taken physics before and always wanted to know more about it."
i bounced around in majors starting off with business.
i really have to stretch my brain to learn about these concepts.
i am not sure why college is so challenging for me.
i was excited coming into this semester to take physics because i am a very logical thinker and i feel physics really falls in line with that line of thinking.
"i take physics 220 this semester as one of my major course, and also the prerequisite of physics 230."
"i have found physics fascinating, i have always like to know how things work, but when it begins getting too complicated i stop."
"i do like physics, at least basic physics, and if i were to pursue a higher level of physics with trigonometry and things like that, my brain would honestly explode."
so i thought sfsu was the best school to go to out of those options.
i've taken online classes before but having all of my major courses online is difficult.
"in addition, in general theres something ive always respected about the stem fields, and thats the search for knowledge with pure motivations, for knowledges sake alone and not for other greedier motives."
this class is a way for me to spend that time i need to further my success in the class and hold myself accountable.
"i needed a slightly lighter load this semester, because my grades have been pretty bad and my living situation has been super unstable."
"that is to say, we lack the skills to solve such a metaphysical question."
i am here in this physics lab course because it is a part of the many other courses that i need the take according to the roadmap that i have decided to follow in order to graduate.
i also like being an example for my brother because he thinks dropping out is an option.
i will be taking physics for the next two or three years of my life and i should begin to have a good relationship with physics instead of being a stubborn procrastinator.
i believe that physics will enrich my life in so many ways.
"in physics class, it could get hard to understand the concept just by lecture."
i have never been great at math and i prefer sciences like bio and chem.
that is a question that i have been asking myself for a while now.
"this summer, i have been fascinated by the study of higher dimensional objects such as hypercubes, hyperspheres, etc; how they would appear in our three dimensional world, and how they would appear if i was a forth dimensional being in a four dimensional world."
i am still very young so i will figure it out.
i am here because i desperately want and need help with organic chemistry.
"therefore, this is really motivating me to get my degree, and help break these statistical boundaries."
"another reason why i am also in this course is to also keep my mind occupied in order to get through the day, through productive means."
i actually enjoy and love doing one of those cool experiments especially the ones that relate somehow to our daily lives.
"i learned lots of new things about astronomy that i didnt learn before like the moon phases, constellations, and other galaxies."
ryan riverai want to go in the stem field and more specifically mechanical engineering because i have always been very interested in rockets.
"being on the premed path right now, i can honestly say that this was meant for me."
"also, this course is a prerequisite to many other major."
this course provides a source of education in terms of how we can see the world today in a more intellectual level in a sense.
"additionally, this lab is a stressfree class since we dont have midterm and final, which inspires me to come to class and learn every day."
i would love to retire when i am older as a park ranger and live in a national forest.
"if the people didnt have smartphones or other technologies at hand, they would have an even harder time spreading information."
in order to hold that i must take certain classes that are geared toward that.
"a bit too many courses for g.e.s i committed to a major that i had wanted to do long before, biology."
but knowing that god is with me throughout my academic journey and this thing called life is comforting.
i see biology as more of an internal subject and how things live.
i think that would be helpful especially when the road gets tough.
"and i think physics will bring me happiness, let me connect with some situations of life from some details, so that i can also use physics knowledge when dealing with emergency situations in the future."
i chose this path to not only secure my future but also to show that the minorities in this world are taking bigger steps forward into being seen as equals.
it will be nice to have friends outside of this group too.
"i could have chosen to take it later, maybe next semester or maybe next year, but i took ap physics in high school so i don't want to prolong it."
my primary goal is to understand how the universe works and function.
"actually, i'm starting to dedicate more time to my physics homework cause i just failed last week's physics quiz so i am working on not doing that anymore."
i decided to come to sfsu because it would save me a lot of money since i am an sf native and i already live here.
i believe that becoming a pharmacist is very underrated.
"being in stem became my dream now for a very selfish reason, to prove to myself that i can accomplish something i considered insurmountable at my lowest point."
"even though it is online, i am learning new programs to work with and still getting a new lab experience."
"i'm not super soaked about my current science classes, so i'm going to change my major to something i enjoy while getting my prerequisites met."
i am here because this is just another obstacle that i need to get through to get one step closer to where and who i am striving to be.
"for example, are there any parts in the globe where polaris cant be seen?"
i am very nervous to take this course because i have no knowledge and can get confused easily.
i first wanted to be an electrical engineer so i could work on the field of renewable energy.
also i love the fitness aspect of it and that it still involves movement and it is not a sedentary job.
my life goal: makes others happy through something i helped push forward and out into the world.
"why i am here, on earth, i dont know."
i was born in germany and grew up across the united states on different military bases.
reflective journaling essay 1 why am i here?
"regardless, i want to be in this class because astronomy is a fun class for me."

being in physics and excelling in this class will prepare me for human anatomy and human physiology which apply directly to my major.
i am taking physics because it is my last requirement before i apply to vet school.
"this peice is essential for me, making the mistakes now and seeing how to avoid them keeps me from doing this process on testsquizes."
and my theory for that is that we do exist for a reason.
i have been told that i am expected to go to college and accomplish all these great things.
"to sum this up, i want to reaffirm myself and say i am here because i want to be."

the reason i plan to go into the stem field is mainly because i love to be around technology and understand how its works.
i'm here at sfsu to get a college education and also because it's the closest school to home and would cost less than going anywhere else.
honestly it wasn't a bad idea i have really liked college life and being away from home.
"due to this, i believe my purpose in life is to continue to improve the world for those to come."
if someone would have asked me if i would want to take physics in the summer at the beginning of the year i would have said absolutely not.
"i have never taken a physics class before, i have only taken a seminar in high school and was always a little scared to fail."
ill be able to give back what they have given me and more.
san francisco is a really good place to explore new concepts and get to know new people.
i get that physics is important because it's everywhere but i can't seem to like physics.
but that was not the case so here we are taking the first part of physics and honestly i'm alright with that.
"other scenarios that require gathering evidence would be cops, forensic scientists, and much more because at the end of the day you need evidence to back up the claim that youre making."
i needed that unit because i am currently behind due to me passing only 11 units last semester.

"also, we have to take one lab course and i choose astronomy 116 thinking it will be easy if i will take astro 115 and 116 simultaneously."
i like the physical part of science and math.
i am here because i am an astronomy major and physics is a pretty big part of that.
why am i here?the reason i am here is to prove myself and the people who have doubted my capabilities all from the start.
i really enjoy this because i am a freshmen and have yet to adapt to the school.
"in order to pass one, you need a little knowledge from all the other courses from stem."
"i never took a physics lab class separately so this will be a new experience for me, but i did do labs in my physics class in high school which were fun."
another thing is that if i didnt come tonight i would not have received my participation credit for today and gotten a lower grade in the class that could have been avoided.
i am here because i put wants over needs.
"another reason would be that i can see how my lab partners work on the assignment, and that in turn motivates me to work harder than them to get it done as fast as i can while still following the requirements of the experiment."
i would say that i am definitely lucky enough to be in a university where students like us get an opportunity to conduct the experiments.
"in addition, this will be very beneficial to me because i would gain better study habits, get better review sheets, and more practice worksheets."
"i took conceptual physics on a whim for one of my ge requirements, and while it wasn't the best class i did enjoy how straightforward it was."
ive taken previous sci courses and they have helped me with understanding topics that are complex.
the stem field is usually challenging and i love to challenge my self when it comes to learning new things.
i believe calculus will enrich my life in so many ways.
"maybe it isphilosophical, trying to make you wonder why humanity exists?"
ive wasted a lot of time here and the influences ive encountered have made my life more complicated.
"i can see myself working in a chemistry lab but i can't see myself trying to write a book (i do like to make my own stories, however, i unfortunately have difficulty on how to write well)."
fall is my favorite season and i adore all of the activities that come along with it.
the reason why i joined the calculus sci course is because i struggle in math.
i am fascinated by the job and i want a career i can look back on and feel proud of my achievements.
i often answer this question by thinking of the past.
why am i specifically in this astronomy lab?
i would also really like to make a difference in the world so that i can leave a mark (hopefully a good one) for once im gone.
i'm here because i'm struggling and am desperately grasping for any hand hold to slow my fall from grace.
but as far as san francisco state thats a whole different beast.
i have always loved science so my initial connection to this was i wanted to work in a lab.
we all have many purposes that we must accomplish throughout our life time.
i should really start saving these and turning resubmitting them because i basically have the same response each time.
i am planning on going into the medical field so i know physics will benefit me in the future.
i am here because i'm a computer science major.
"for starters, i am here because i believe that receiving some type of education whether its good or bad can be used for the future."
i really hope this class continues to help me prepare for a physics tests as physics has so many problems and many formulas attached to it.
"the answer is simple, i am here in my room doing school work because of the ongoing pandemic."
"however, i think taking them at the same time will allow the material of the course to stay fresh in my mind so i can apply it later."
"i'm here not only because it's a requirement, but a bit because small things have gotten in my way in my previous three years of college that have prevented me from taking it sooner."
i failed twice because i have bad depression and ptsd. taking this class and passing it is a goal for me so i prove to myself that i can get better.
"this year i am taking classes that go towards my actual major which is exciting, but its very challenging now."
i never knew about the constellation called ophiuchus before taking astronomy 116.
i originally enrolled in physics 222 since i was enrolled in physics 221.
"however, i soon discovered that finance is just not my type, so i changed my major to computer science."
in order to fulfill those steps i have chosen my major as biology and i am following the classes requirements that will get me to that degree!
"i realized i dont have enough time this semester to do an internship because i need to work a lot this semester, and im trying to get my cumulative gpa up past a 3.0 so i can get into a grad school program."
this class is one the required prerequisites for my major and any biology concentration i would want to pursue.
i am in this class because i am taking astronomy 115 and this lab coincides with that class.
i also find math an easier topic for me than english so that probably has an impact on my decision to do this as well.
physics is an interesting topic and i do enjoy it but im primary here given its a required for my major of comp sci.
"the stem field certainly is challenging and i dislike how challenging it is, but getting through will prove that i am prepared for the future."
i am looking forward to learning more of physics so i can understand the world in a different perspective
i have not taken a physics class before and i think this will be a great opportunity to learn more about it.
sebastian johnson phys 112.03 912020 why am i here?
"sorry, the reason for the late assignment is because i added the class, and originally wrote the answer on paper, since i didn't have access to ilearn."
i hope calculus will support my learning in this course in any shape or form.
i hate math which makes it even harder for me to love and learn physics.
"since i have not taken chemistry in over three years, having sci course will hopefully keep my grade up for chemistry 2."
i think that physics is a very visual science that requires labs in order to be understood.
my dad wouldn't let go of the cheap backpacks they gave us with the school logo on it.
i only hope that this class will continue to help me with chem this semester and maybe give me something i havent learned in the past.
"i chose to take a path that would teach me about the stars, the moon, and what lever else is above us."
"coming from a lowincome family, having no financial support, and growing on my own were some things i had to face."
"i feel that way because i'm a little behind on my studies and thats do to the fact that i used to commute from gilroy to sf, but this year i recently moved to sf but now its more challenging for me because my preferred method of instruction is in person instead of virtual and now i have t o be able to get used to be in class while being at home."
"not specifically just to learn physics, but to better my understanding of the world around me."
hopefully things get back to normal soon because i miss the inperson class environment.
"i strive to live this life everyday, although i am not perfect."
these are classes that i need for my major and i do not want to retake them again.
my first physics class was here at sfsu and it was an eye opener.
i think that i can learn a lot and i do like learning things that a person does not think about on a normal basis.
also i don't want to take lecture then lab a different semester and not be able to remember everything that i learned.
"at first, i took chemistry because it was required for my major, but my feeling towards this course changed because chem 115 was fun."
"although it is harder to do that in the time that we live in, there are still ways to prove this to be true."
why i'm here is a pretty broad question but can also be answered with the domino effect of my personal choices (and non personal ones).
"i don't think she might have known it at the time when she had me, but i've been the most consistently there for her as long as i could be, i think that's why i'm here to make sure that she has everything that she needs and so she always has someone on her side."
"i also plan on taking other physics courses in the future, so it is important for me to understand this course well."
"though i love to write fiction, the fact that it is not the most stable option does not elude me."
i am at san francisco state university because it is a very diverse school and i like the environment here.
"so, here i am now, taking this physics lab."
i think i am here because i was born.
"although i'm admittedly exhausted, and the pandemic does chip away at my motivation sometimes, i have a lot of goals and things that i want to accomplish, and this class just so happens to be along the way of the goals that i want to reach!its a little difficult to find more things to write about since im tired, but i hope that things (classes, grades, health, family) go smoothly and that this semester turns out to be alright despite the numerous variables that are bound to go against us at some point."
in continuing my education i am preparing myself to pursue my career and have a good future.
i just wanted a space where i could ask questions when im lost and be surrounded by people who are taking the same class as me.
why i'm here is a good question but a very vague one.
it helps me understand the world around me on a daily basis so i make even more informed decisions even if it is in the tiniest of details.
overall i am bad with anything that has an equation in it and needs to be solved.
one of these goals is being in a career i enjoy.
"i think there is a reason why i won out of the others because i survived and won, which i guess you could say made me more superior than my other siblings."
it would be best that i know how to write it in an organized way that makes it easy to understand the patients status.
"because the size of the class, i dont feel as embarrassed to ask questions."
my laziness and procrastination is what caused me to be here.
"id like to say i'm pretty good at biology, chemistry, and math but when i come to physics i'm completely lost and almost have no interest."
"although joining the class wasn't something i chose for myself, at least for the rest of the semester i'm choosing for myself that i will a's the course."
"i chose to take this class because i remember physics being fun, especially during highschool."
i enjoy the process of breaking down problems to a point that they can be solved.
maybe the idea of being a surgeon is what i like the most.
"i did not take physics until early on in college, and a lot of what i learned helped make sense of what i learned over the past few years in biology and chemistry."
i'm here because i basically just want to do something with my life although right now at the moment i'm not so sure what i want yet.
another reason i am here is because i want to be able to help others by learning something myself.
i have a pretty tight group of friends at home that i live with.
i feel really blessed to be here because its a city where i have developed myself as an adult.
i have taken physics before and it is one of the few classes that is challenging because of the many different ways problems can be solve and the different explanations there is.
"with sfsu i'm able to live at home and save a lot of money that way, even though it does affect my mental health to be honest."
"i enjoy physics and the applications of physics, but if i had my own choice or another avenue to go down i do not think school would be that route."
i am looking forward to this semester eventhough i know it will be a lot of work.
"one of the reason i chose this degree is because it allows me to segue into a number of other career fields, and i find comfort in knowing i have that option available to me."
"i believe the opening question from one of the main characters from the show is you ever wonder why were here? well, i sometimes like to wonder why im here, but usually stop to accept the fact that i am here now."
"microbiology covers all of the cls class requirements, and physics is a requirement for the microbiology degree."
the reason that i am taking general physics is that i need the class as a prerequirement for medical school.
"to be honest, i don't know why i am here."
i think i'm here because of destiny and it is my job to figure out if my fate is here.
hopefully in physics lab we get to learn more indepth about it and learn other interesting topics in physics besides the basics.
"last semester, i took a sci class and it definitely helped me get an a in a class that i thought i would struggle in."
i became extremely fascinated in the sizes of these planets and what they were made of.
"and if the result is matching the equation, i not only would feel happy, but also rewarding."
"i have never taken a physics course before, but i have always been pretty good at math."
"i put a ton of work into the semester and achieved all a's, but during this period i had less of a social life."
"i want to make a difference in this world and if i can touch just one person in this lifetime, then i will be satisfied."
i am here because i wish to pursue my education and learn more about computer technology and engineering.
"i have always been a very curious person, from breaking stuff just to see what is inside anything to disassemble and assemble things."
i am confident that by studying and working with the sci class that i may feel more confident in the topic.
"i find physics to be really interesting, and important to understand what is happening in the physical world."
"overall, i know that physics is a major requirement for a reason."
i am here because i am in need of extra supplementation for cell bio.
i don't regret any of those decisions since i'm doing the best that i can while trying to make the most out of the experience of being up here in an engineering program.
"i love the excitement, the knowledge, and the help i would put towards others as a nurse."
i have never taken physics in my life until now.
"in terms of my presence, i believe that god has a time and place for myself here in this school, earth, and where i am in life."
i could not let that sacrifice be for nothing.
it is one of the three main classes that are prerequisites for other classes.
"i intend to reach my goal no matter what, but first i need to finish all of my prerequisites in order to get to my cinema classes."
after struggling in an accounting class i felt that i wanted to major in a science.
"now that i am thinking about it, a lot of factors lead me to be exactly right here in this moment in lab at 9:30 on a tuesday."
this is what learning should be.
im a biology major.
"the logic and the tediousness is no longer weird or annoying, it is necessary and helpful."
i am here because this course is required for my major of mechanical engineering because it will teach me critical information that will later serve as a foundation for more advanced courses.
i have transferred from fiji and have been in the us since 2015.
one is take up the major leading to my dreamkinesiology.
my major is computer science and part of my major requirements is to take physics and this physics lab.
i'm excited to learn about physics and finally gain the understanding that i should've gained in high school.
but in this modern era of overpopulation and different sexualities doesn't mean that you have to bear children.
i think that kind of answer is the best outcome any wants.
she told me all about it and how it was so interesting to her.
hopefully this course helps me more in the class and doesnt confuse me.
i've always believed that anything is possible if applied correctly.
the reason why im here is because i need to take this class in order for me to continue with my other requirements for my major.
this is the reason i chose to be a computer science major.
"i think learning and understanding how the world works is important; we all have some innate desire to know the origins of our existence, and physics is a means to that end."
"it was not until, i started college that i realized my passion for biology, and decided to major in biology."
the second reason would be my goal to achieve my degree in biology.
i took sci bio 230 like 2 semesters ago and it was literally great.
people only fear things because they don't understand it.
"therefore i can apply those experience to physics and engineering courses, thus make the transition from real life to classwork to be less than a hassle."
i dont know where i see myself in 5 years.
"furthermore, i always had a dream to be an astronaut to see with my own eyes how earth really looks like and how is it like in space, even though i know it is not so easy to become one."
in all honesty i am not really a big fan of physics.
"for a deeper answer, i chose to major in computer science because i enjoy problemsolving."
there are a lot of concepts in physics that interest me a lot like how atoms behave and how charges work.
that is why i am here in college at san francisco state university.
i would like to dedicate my time and effort to the best of my ability to broaden my knowledge of physics.
this is why i am here at this school and in this class.
now that i have math done it is the only subject that i am worried about not being able to understand.
"i would like to learn how to manage my time better, so that i have sufficient time to complete my lab."
"i think it's fascinating how a plane takes off and lands, feeling the force on my chest, and the sweat in my palms scares me."
i am here because i care about my grades and about the effort i put in.
the learning curve has been quite impacted with the political covid19.
"as an environmental studies major, taking a physics course is not in my core classes nor is it an elective for my major."
i feel like why am i here is a very straightforward question to so many people but it can mean so many things.
i love learning and sharing my knowledge with my friends and family.
i think being her stands as a reminder that i would like to integrate myself into something bigger than me.
i am aiming to earn an a in this class and move on to the next classes knowing physics.
i understand how to do math but setting up the problem was always a challenge for me.
this lab will help us get to know physics little better as we will not only read about it but will do experiments first hand.
i cant take any other courses for my major until i take ochem so im in a weird state of relaxation.
"although, i do believe that everyone has their own purpose and that life has a way of leading you to where you need to be."
she has guided me throughout my life in wanting me to be successful.
"when i first read this question, i thought it was asking about why im here in the world."
i dont think i have exactly figured out what my purpose is but im working on finding it.
but i think my purpose in life is just to exist and live the best life that i possibly can without the burden of needing to do something great.
whats cool about taking this class here is that we have a planetarium and telescope on the roof of the science building.
a lot of chemistry is involved in how molecules move around and operate.
if i do not do this then i will not be in upper division standing which will then prevent me from entering into my major.
i am really bad at chemistry and physics though.
my mind is always blown when im learning new topics regarding the subject.
"im here for motivation and what i mean is when i dont know how to start or complete a problem, sometimes ill just end up giving up because i had no help."
"the second reason i am here is i actually enjoy doing math, but i am not sure about physics."
turns out i'm not as interested and my last lab teacher did not make the class interesting nor was he helpful when i was struggling to understand certain things.
"plus stem is also in a majority of the jobs we see today, and many of the high paying jobs are in this field."
getting to where i am now at san fransisco state university with my current major and with my current goals definitely was not an easy journey.
"in the past, when i took precalculus, i went to tutoring at least three hours a week and that is the only reason why i passed the class with an a. i think it is important to force myself into situations where i need to focus and work on the subject i am not good at even if that means i am more exhausted by the end of the day."
i guess my purpose in life is to live my best life.
i think that i am here because of a number of bumps that i have overcome.
the biology sci 230 class was the first sci class i ever took.
"but regardless of this, i know that every class i ever take in my lifetime will be for the betterment of it, and my view of it."
i am here because it is one of my premajor requirements.
there needs to be more positivity in life and i feel like if i can even try to make that impact on others around me then im fulfilling my life purpose.
coupled with the fact that i didn't fully understand concepts i ended up failing like every single quiz.
i feel like this system is very slow for students to understand the material as opposed to handson experiences like this lab class.
i chose this specific time because i just wanted to get this class done as early as possible so i can have the rest of the day to do whatever i want to do.
"after multiple students had walked in most of my stem classes, i thought why not give it a try and add it to my schedule?"
so far this class has been surprisingly fun and i actually learned a lot that helps me with the class.
and also to see that i am not alone in my confusion over some of the things we are learning.
what is my identity?
i would like to apply how can i find places and how can i find bigger deepper or brights stars from this class.
i am a senior.
me being here is actually quite a surprise to me.
"well, i would say its mainly because this is a prerequisite for my classes."
also on top of learning college is a place that you can network and make connections to people from different places to broaden your point of view socially and in some ways politically.
it seems pretty simple so far but i am taking a lot of classes.this class seems fun so far experimenting with stuff.
i also learn how to collaborate more with my peers and ask more questions.
"i'm here not mainly because i have to be, but moreover because i want to."
"that is the reason why i am at this school, then i am going to talk about why i am in this class."
i feel like they just do math all the time which is what i do as well while i'm going about my life.
i took ap biology and i did really well.
"but it has been a long time since i have last taken that class, so i think that my physics foundation is not as strong."
so that's why i in this class.
my dad is 70 and he's still doing hard labor to earn a living.
the beginning of my childhood was spent in the philippines and it was not until i came to california and more specifically once i reached college that i realized i was given all the tools necessary to succeed.
i prefer learning how things work than just memorizing a bunch of facts.
i think the subject is interesting and understand some basics concepts.
i am excited for this physics class and thats because in high school i took a physics class.
"anyways, the path im referring to is basically the roadmap of the career im currently interested in, which is being a physician in emergency medicine; in other words, im unsure if i should pursue this career due to financial reasons and time."
i think that being in this lab class will be helpful because we work in groups for the most part.
"i love to learn about the planets, stars, and the whole outerspace."
i also like that every individual here is different and i get to know a little bit about their background.
i found sci 230 to be super helpful in my studying and getting me to really grasp concepts.
i was very unhappy with what i was pursuing and became very unmotivated; this led to me dropping out of school.
"knowing what formulas to use, and to know when it is the appropriate time to use it."
my knowledge on the subject of calculus other than the basics is kind of abysmal and my knowledge when it comes to electricity and magnetism is pretty bad.
"i hope the further along i go, the easier it will be to complete the labs and gain an understanding."
"the human body, specifically our bones, joints, and tendons all move in different directions and provide different amounts of force that can be acted upon."
"for example, i've always wanted to do an experiment testing out how different objects have more or less friction."
"i know that sounds cliche, but it is true."
i wanted to study space and it's mystery characteristics.
"i still believe it is so, all these formulas, conversions, and isolation thinking, makes it very hard for me to determine."
its like a domino effect if i mess up on one class.
but sometimes i just feel like changing my major because of many reasons.
"first off, i am at this university so i can get a proper education."
luckily i got added to this lab just before the last day that i was allowed to get into a lab to stay in class.
i am taking this class because i want to get the extra help and support while trying to learn new concepts in calculus 2.
to be precise i am taking this class because it's a prerequisite for my course.
"for the other reason, i am interested to learn physics."
"it gives me a confidence boost within myself to explore more, and try to make more friends."
but thats asking a lot homestly but most of us as college students work and its difficult to go around it sometimes.
"so i entered the course wanting the help needed to understand all the content being taught in lecture in a more dumbed down and simpler setting, and to force myself to study the content."
i am here in physics because it is a requirement for my major.
i am taking physics at a time where my educational maturity is at a certain point where i am ready to take on this class and also know that i have the capacity to do my best.
the main reason i'm here is because i found the lecture don't provide much support in solving exercises due to the broad amount of material from each chapter.i've been advised during the orientation to take this support to help me improve my understanding of the class content.
i cant see myself as anything and im just stuck or im actually just not sure where im going or if im going down the right path.
it seems to have employment opportunity in the future which definitely sounds safe.
"home is where i feel appreciated, comfortable, and proud to be at."
"right now, i am really stuck on vectors and calculating vectors."
"so the reason why i am here in this class is to fully understand how physics work without having to worry about very large equations, but only the bare minimum to understand how physics worked in real life in many simpler terms."
i just know that i like science and math and i enjoy learnig different subjects and different perspectives of theses subject.
"in this case, it was helpful to learn about conduction and induction last lab, because it helped give me a better idea of how things work, instead of just having to think about it."
and thats only one of the many aspects of stem that makes me want to pursue it.
"originally i wanted to be a computer scientist coder and learn how to hack, but after realizing that coding wasnt for me i drifted apart from that idea because it ended up not working for me."
the other reason i am here is because it's a requirement but i don't see it like that way.
im hoping that sci will help me to get started on complex problems which sometimes can scare me from the beginning.
conceptual physics was a bit of a breeze but this semesters class is turning out to be anything but that.
"so far, the engineering classes have been really enjoyable and tough."
if i was capable of doing my work while in labor i have tons of reasons why i am here!
physics can be confusing at times but i enjoy the math part of it for the most part.
"however, i look forward to taking physics again at a college level and interested to see how it will go with an online setting instead of meeting facetoface."
if i had the natural understanding i would not be here.
having sci as a class with set times will really positively affect my learning and studying.
"i lived in mexico for almost half my life and i know how bad the situation over there is, you cant really succeed and when the opportunity to move to the usa and have a better life came up it was something i couldnt say no to."
"why am i here?i am here in this astronomy lab course because of my interest in space, the stars, planets and constellations."
my purpose is for me to bring joy and happiness to those around me.
"if i take it later, i might lose all my knowledge on the subject, whereas if i take it now, all my previous studying will be fresh in my head."
"i took the job and as soon as i set foot on my first big construction site, i knew there was something there for me."
i am a undergrad mechanical engineering student and i have to finish my phy classes to graduate.
"the reason for that is because i have not taken physics at all, not even in highschool."
"however, after working in the pharmaceutical setting, i came to realize that the work i was performing did not leave myself feeling satisfied but, instead, weary and tired."
i should be able to apply what i learned from last semester into this class and maybe help some people out if they are stuck.
"im basically here to further my education and to definitely learn something new, that i havent learned before."
i am expecting to learn what physics is all about since i've never taken a physics course ever and hopefully i can utilize it in my everyday life so i'd be 'good to go' when i have my job after i graduate.
anyways i have mark andrews at tight end should be a great year for him.
"in the end, i decided to make sf state my home because i wanted to get away from home yet still be in the vicinity."
i am here because i have to take this class.
"putting this all together, i am here because i thought sci would be a great way to help me fully understand physics."
i look forward to a great semester.
"the first year was pretty hard, and i was always thinking i was so inferior."
personally i think living here was way easier than it is now as rent is super high and the cost of living has drastically increased.
it should be mine too then.
hopefully we will get to graduate at the same time too.
im hoping to meet more people affiliated with my major and be more involved with students who are willing to learn and experience more on campus.
i also like to rock climb and i teach rock climbing as well as an american mountain guide instructor (amga).
right now my purpose in life is to just get through this pandemic because i just want it to end and i want things to go back to normal.
"with a lot of hard work and dedication, i was able to master my craft and was given more responsibilities by my superiors."
"for one, being able to use numbers to solve problems, or for example determine how large of a dose a patient may need in a hospital is an incredibly beneficial skill."
i decided to go into the sci class because i was talking to my friend about it.
i've been just living my life to the fullest each day at least because i know life is short and that you don't really have much time on this earth especially all those climate changes and all that.
"although that is one of the reasons, im also genuinely interested in physics because it plays such a huge role in our daily lives and having a deeper understanding of that intrigues me."
this is the last of my ges that i have to take and i am hoping to finish everything on a good note.
"so when i think about the reason why im here, i know theres no reason but thats the exact same reason why i try to live purposefully."
i also love learning about the human body and of its complex processes.
i need to know how much force is required to lift your arm and what lever systems that your joints use when lifting said arm.
biology is interesting to me because theres always something new i learn every lecture.
i am in the sci230 class to better understand what i am learning in both the lecture and lab class.
"im actually enjoying the course all that said otherwise, hopefully itll stay on that level for the rest of the semester."
the main reason i want to go into the stem field is because it is really interesting and very useful in our day to day life.
another reason is to fill the minimum units for the semester because other classes were full or didn't enroll in them.
"because back then the country was so strict that most husbands would not allow a man see their wives, even if it was during birth."
sometimes i learn better when other people explain rather than teachers.
i enrolled in this class because organic chemistry is one of those subjects where most people struggle a lot in and i do not want to struggle like they did so thats the main reason why i am here.
"also, because i took so long to take the next course, i forgot a lot of what i had learned."
all while not having enough at the end of the day to provide the life i want to my family and myself.
with major changes and not knowing where i land in the firsts year and feeling like i had to play catch up the following two and even in my last year.
"i truly believe my huge personality, when combined with my career interests and natural talents, were placed here to spread love throughout those i cross paths with in life."
i've been to many schools in my college journey and this is the place where i will get my ba and hopefully masters.
"i ended up choosing stem, specifically electrical engineering, for a couple of reasons."
"sometimes i wonder if i should have just stayed at my community college at home, because it its way cheaper and also online."
"i am not just here but i am present, to learn what i can to help the world in my own way through science, through justice, and from the heart."
"there are so many bad days that i encounter, but when a good day comes along, it seems almost worth it."
"it was the challenge i had been missing in my previous majors, and a new passion emerged."
however after we dropped off the patient at the hospital i would probably never see that patient again.
"i am dedicated to passing chemistry, as it is the only science i am truly struggling in."
i'm having a good time putting to productive use the things that i've learned while also being able to interact with many different individuals.
"physics are important for a lot of everyday live problems, from driving a car to skiing."
"you know, sometimes i ask that question a lot."
my friend passed away recently from a disease.
many obstacles came up that made me rethink my values.
"i believe life is a step by step journey, that can be broken down into many little parts."
"these two things, i believe would the most influential aspects of this class on my future, and would help me conduct better thinking in my future classes in both college and medical school."
i am in physics 230232 because i have to take this class in order to take other classes for the future.
"however, if this an existential question, i guess i am here like everyone else to serve a purpose."
sometimes i enjoy them more than biology labs because theyre more chill and you dont have to follow a strict dress code.
i already took physics classes in spain but i am required to take physics for my major.
i am here at sfsu because i have had a strong connection with san francisco since i was a little kid.
it may take me hours and hours to grasp a basic concept but i always do no matter what which is why i succeed and those who are overconfident fail.
i also value friendliness.
ive been able to make connections here with friends that explain anything im confused about in simple terms without making me feel like im dumb for not knowing.
i was trying to take it at a community college but they were trying to make me take many math classes before taking the general physics 1 course they had.
i like gaining the new perspective on what i see and hope to be able to use this knowledge going forward to test or even extend what i know.
i am majoring in computer science.
"i am here because i enjoyed doing math, doing experiments, and putting things together."
"im not sure what it is, whether im more confident, or if i just dont give as much of a shit."
i am here in physics 102 to complete as one of my requirements towards my major.
i used to struggle with physics in high school and understanding it.
we cant deny that the computer has a huge relationship with physics.
maybe even tying those two things together.
"in order to get that far in my dreams, i obviously have to pass biology class."
"i am hoping by taking this sci class i will give myself more opportunities to study, and work out the things that i may be unsure about."
"these are also present in physics, and it is easy to see that the process carries over on to computer science."
why am i here?
"i am passionate about learning about animals, humans, and things such as diseases and viruses."
i think that i decided to add this class so i could ask questions and also practice problems relating to calculus 2.
i figured that it would help me really understand the base concepts of physics.
i know how difficult chemistry 115 can be so im doing my best to stay on top of everything.
i found that i liked problems that had one solution.
it has helped shaped me into a much more practical person without pruning my creative capabilities.
"i had found astronomy interesting when i took it as a lecture class last semester, and now i find my self in a difficult positions because of the math aspect of astronomy."
i hope in this class i am able to learn about many questions of why i have of how objects interact with each other.
i really need sony michel to come through though with the patriots.
"i hope that this class will not only help me study on my exams, but to also help with homework problems."
i really don't know why i'm here.
"at the time i wasn't sure what major i was interested in, but there was one thing that confirmed major."
hopefully i can use the lab portion of the course to help me better understand the lecture portion and physics overall.
i am in this specific lab because my schedule got screwed up.
i always looking for conversations and this is a great way to find them in topics i am also interested in.
"i actually did not mind taking physics because i took it in high school before so the material was not new to me and even though i found it difficult sometimes i actually really enjoyed it, i learnt a lot of new things in the class and opened my mind to new things."
i have taken other sci classes and i have noticed that i do better when i have more than one person helping me break down the concept to really learn how to do the problems on my own.
"in general, i study within the stem field because it really interest me but, also in part, because i feel like i am good at it and that this option of field seems manageable and align with my future goals."
i originally have chosen another college in a different city.
its a bit stressful because im lost.
i don't want riches; just enough to not live in constant fear of failing to meet basic needs and want that for others.
sometimes i feel that i am too old to be in school especially this semester.
i am here because i am struggling with ochem.
im here in my astronomy lab class because i need the class to finish the lab portion for my general education.
so i wanted to give it a try!
"i do not love physics, but i am willing to see how these concepts will better prepare me for the future."
"ive put myself into a world of science and philosophy and i am able to understand how the two really depend on the other, and how they can reflect through me."
it is not easy and its time consuming but in the end its all worth it.
"sports is the only thing i know a lot about and staying active is something that has always been a part of my life and i figured since i have the most knowledge and i love it, it would be the best option for me."
once you start college and feel that freedom you never felt before your life changes rapidly.
"i had been considering it throughout that whole year, but i didn't think i was ""smart enough."" luckily i gained the courage by the end of the year to follow my dreams!"
"there are 2 career plans i'm thinking about,: physical therapy or medicine school."
also another reason why i am here is because i want to meet new people and eventually become good friends with people who were once strangers.
this being the biggest difference between this course and my high school class.
this is reflective journaing on why i am here the great philisopical question.
i think i will do better in this class because of that.
i wanted to feel it out and see how the energy was.
i decided to enroll into the physics supplemental course because ive had a history of struggling in my math classes.
"i am in this physics class because i do not know what i want to do with my life, but i am good at math and science."
the reason why i signed up for the sci 215 class was to get extra help for chem 215 because it is a challenging class and i did to make sure i understand the concepts i didn't understand in class.
i am also taking organic and biochemistry so passing this 5 unit course is very important to me in order for me to graduate on time.
"i feel like my head is always working, it so weird to explain but like i just be thinking to myself like imagine if we our phone battery could last longer."
"i can understand my professor much better now, so i am understanding the material much better and not struggling along."
i just hope i do figure out what i like to do and what is my purpose in life.
but i did not really learn the topic how i should have.
and i think i am going to stop right here.
"if i did not need this class for my major, i would not have taken it."
"my mother used to quiz me on them from a young age, and i could watch tv excessively if it were medical dramas."
but i am here for an education to kick start my career.
college hasn't been easy but i know in the end itll all be worth the middle of night stress cries.
"although most things are man made like the computer i am typing on, the earth itself is not, in my opinion."
"there are many parallels that can be drawn between physics and my choice of major (math with a concentration in teaching), specifically the numerics involved, but in my time taking physics i've discovered that the math involved in physics takes a different, more complex form than in calculus despite using calculus concepts."
"i'm also in this class because i genuinely enjoy doing labs especially physics labs as opposed to just a lecture, it helps me to get a better understanding of physics concepts so everything isn't just math and formulas."
but now struggling in college is worrisome.
the space seems safe to express my concerns and questions.
"i understand it, thats why i like getting involved in it."
honestly i am here just for the credits i need to get into my major.
being in the sci 230 classroom also allows me to work on my biology homework and have it reviewed which in turn helps me save time for other work outside of class.
i chose physics as my major for two main reasons.
"so to summarize my first point, more job opportunity implies more stability."
nevertheless i am eager to learn about the science and why it fascinates many others.
"what attracts me most about physical therapy is the job description includes many of the things i like and the skills i have proficiency in, as well as allows for my failings."
i am here because i need to be.
im retaking it this semester and i am more confident in passing.
sometimes i know why i am where i am in an exact moment and sometimes i figure that out later down the road.
"the question i often ask myself from time to time is, why am i here?"
i am here in this class because i have to concurrently be enrolled in a lab along with my physics class.
the question why am i here is so broad.
it is important to be able to relate the way in which these different theories are a part of the real word and our life.
why am i here?its a question that i get a lot in classes nowadays.
"i think life is rather short, so we should use our time with it wisely."
"whether it is the professors here at sfsu or subject itself, the entire subject is difficult to learn and understand."
"second, is to create and find discoveries that future populations can use to make more discoveries in this world."
"in particular, i was always fascinated by the giant machines that would route balls all over a tank through rails, air pressure, and other things because of how many moving parts there were."
going to class can be more clear than just reading from a book because you have explanations to help you.
"though the requirements for being premed are simply a year of physics, a year of chem, and a year of bio, i realized that in college i want to delve deeper into these classes and not just do the minimum requirements."
i have not had much experience with the subject of physics so i am hoping that this class will fulfill my expectations.
"i then learned in the beginning of this semester that in order to take the lecture, you have to be in the lab at the same time."
being diagnosed with a chronic condition is one of them.
during this course i hope to learn about somethings i find interesting or may have heard of .
"so far its been tough and sometimes, honestly, i dont wanna be here."
"so to fully answer the question, ""why am i here"", i would have to say i am ultimately here to learn all of the information i need to know to take do successful on the mcat so that i can attend an amazing medical school so that one day i am able to become an inspiring female trauma surgeon."
i used to hate physics at high school because the teacher was not passionate about teaching.
i think is class will go hand and hand with my math class because so far we're learning about vectors.
"however, i do believe there is a greater purpose to all things and the why is much deeper than simply getting a degree, stable job, and nice family."
it is also fun to do physics expirements and do the math.
"i believe i am here for a reason, only god knows."
"question: why am i here? in this course, i am trying to get some help some other classmates and the students that had recently took this class, engr 305, for help to get the course topic understandable and major able to catch up to the class."
the forensic department sounds awesome because you work with the police and that would be great to help out at a crime scene and help the police.
"peoples cognition, in my opinion, has in many ways deteriorated."
i honestly would rather not be in the hot and lowceilinged trailer for a physics lab.
i would like to see how the concepts i learn here can apply to everyday situations.
college by default is a recommendation from society and communities alike.
hopefully this will be a great semester and i do well.
"i was able to see that not only am i here in college to make money, but also to establish myself as an adult."
i loved my physics one very much however i disliked the lab part of the course so i am hoping that this lab course is better.
"when i was young, i read about farraday and how he went from being an insignificant lab assistant to leading sections of physics by simply working with an open mind."
i wanted to be able to have a product that i put a lot of effort into and be proud of at the end of the day.
it isn't enough to set a goal in mind.
"in high school, i did not do very well in academics, partly because the environment was so competitive, but also because i struggled a lot with classes and eventually just ""gave up"" on trying to do well since i felt like i could never do well."
"they do not judge if we get a question wrong, which is a major thing for me because it makes me feel more comfortable to actually ask questions."
"i am studying earth sciences emphasizing in geology, and i have taken notice in some of the major chasses that physics is being applied in the way we express some of the systems of earth."
"also, i am still very new to physics as i do not recall much from my previous physics class and was very bad at understanding how motion works in general."
because it interests me.
"in the future i want to either get into the medical field or get into law, that is another reason why i am in biology."
"i would want my career choice to be able to help others which is why so far, i have thought of becoming a pediatrician due to my interest in working with children."
i am currently taking physics111 at the same time.
education is something valued and normalized in today's society.
i sometimes have to force myself to get to school but i do it in order to fulfill this goal.
i also do hope to be able to make contributions to help better my family.
thats what college is supposed to be all about.
although i know i am barely scratching the surface of my full potential in life and wherever it is that i may end up is still unknown.
"i was made a foreman and had the responsibility of running a project, along with a crew of carpenters."
for some people it is just a requirement that they have to knock out in order to complete their major but i actually have a lot of fun with these interactive type of tests.
i managed to do well but was never accepted back into a lab section because classes were way too full each semester.
i try to do my absolute best and will continue trying to get good grades.
"from what i hear, this is one of those classes that shows who is ready for a very hard class that is not necessarily required knowledge but is used when going to medical school."
"the purpose for me going into stem is for my parents, like a lot of people probably."
i think being here in san francisco state offers me an opportunity to learn different things to open doors for me in the future.
most of all i am here because this school is safe and i have a better opportunity than where i was born so i'll take advantage of that.
i went into sf state as a general business major because i wanted to open my own bakery.
"san francisco state university is also located in one of the greatest cities, so it was a pretty easy decision to come to school here."
"if i hadnt taken this course, i wouldnt have known much about this topic."
"with a changing climate we have impending crises in the ocean, water supply, habitable living space, and food supply."
"math always gives me a little trouble, but i get a hang of it after pushing myself to do the best i can."
i took and passed physic with calculus 1 a year ago and i struggled at the beginning and towards the end of the course.
i may or may not change major but i just wanted to keep my options to different subjects in the are of science.
also i found out that be it that i already have conceptual physics under my belt i dont actually require this class which is a dash aggravating because its so difficult and im past the point of no return.
"overall, i'm so far more than satisfied why i'm here."
i am here for the purpose of furthering my career.
"im usually lost in my head, and that leads me to feel lost in life."
"so to wrap it up the main reason on why i am is here is because it is a required class, but also i kind of enjoy physics and the challenge that comes with solve the problems."
"i choose this school because it was close and i enjoy living in sf, other places aren't as nice and i felt i would receive the most benefit going to a school in my city."
i came to sf state alone and not knowing anyone but i have to say it was the best decision that i made.
"i""m at sfsu because i love the opportunities that the city offers and the diverseness as well."
i really dont know how to answer this question.
i am also here in college because i wanted to prove to them that i can be successful and complete college.
"i plan to use this knowledge so that i may excel in solving geologic problems in my career, and positively impact the world."
"when i think about this question, i did not come up with the strong reason."
i am in this physics because it is a class i have to take to satisfy my major requirements.
i attend every class so i can get the most out of my education and learn the vital facts about physics.
i have to pass these other classes or else i will not be able to move on with my major courses.
"i think i will have financial security working as a physician, as there will always be people who get sick or injured."
taking this course will give us those chances to meet and greet in a way with fellow peers.
i chose to go to college and i plan to use my time going to school as wisely as possible.
the question seems quite broad and i dont know exactly how to answer this question.
"after the first few weeks of my organic chemistry class, i already felt like i was falling behind."
iam here to help myself achieve my goals of being successful.
"to be a wellrounded student, you should be able to know at least the basics of some different subjects, and then you can focus on learning a lot about the one, or two, subjects youve chosen to study."
overall i am taking the sci course to give me the extra support i feel i needs to succeed in math 227.
"i am taking this class not only becuase it is required for my desired major, but also becuase i find it interesting."
ive always had an idea to work in medicine as a lab technician.
i am very lucky to be at san francisco state because not everyone is able to get a college education.
"physics has always come easier to me, and science in general, so that is why i do not plan on dropping the class."
"it is satisfying to me how i can connect physics in to everyday life, and how equations in physics connects to the world."
"the extra time spent practicing, asking questions, in a more chill environment helps a lot."
"secondly, i think it is very important to know the science behind magnetism and electricity especially if i am studying a topic that relies on electricity."
sometimes i ask myself the same thing.
having a good understanding of physics will also help me in my biology career as they share many of the same aspects.
"thus, i am hopeful that i can exercise that hypothesis."
i know that answer is very vague but it is true.
my name is student name and this is my second year at san francisco state university.
i don't want to see the people around me suffer from diseases or be in pain.
having a degree will allow me to get a good paying job in the future.
"furthermore, some of the things in these physics classes are new to me, however, it is very interesting to learn these things."
"i also really want to understand the basic concepts of physics, because i will be taking physics 2 next semester."
"i want me to have an easy life after they stop working(hopefully) so i can give back some of their life that they ""wasted""(joke) on me."
i am here because my financial help would cover the costs of this class and not a class in skyline.
my main reason for taking this class is to prepare myself for my future studies and eventually my future career goals.
"the difference between a general biology major versus something like cell molecular biology is that you go more into depth with calculus, physics, and chemistry."
to be honest i am pursuing a computer science degree and physics 2 and the lab is one of the requirements for it.
ive also found that physics has been a good brain gym in some ways.
i dont think i like astronomy as much really any science except for biology and chemistry as they focus more on our bodiesare relevant to the human bodiesexperience.
"this is the last math class i will have to take to fulfill my degree requirements, but i hope to gain a better understanding of the material as it may help me at some point later in life."
"and that's what i've always felt called to be, just a helpful, good, nice person in society since there's a bunch of bad in the world."
i am using this as a class to maintain the proper amount of credits to keep my financial aid.
i have not taken a physics class since high school but i am hoping this class will be a good refresher without being too difficult.
why am i here in this lab?
"nevertheless, from the day he passed, everything i do and will do will be for him."
but at this moment in my life i'm working part time and going to school not just to keep myself busy but also for my future.
"my grandpa, though with very little money, would always bring money on his way to work in the mornings so that he could buy bread and coffee to any homeless people he came across."
i love knowing how things work and how certain things can affect their surroundings.
i am taking this physics class because i need it to get my general education classes finished.
it is important to me to have a class that wants the students to succeed and ensures that we are all on the same page and understand the content being given.
"i like to learn new concepts and apply them to other fields or concepts that create a deeper context and more connected mindmap of ideas, because i think ultimately most things are related or connected in some way."
"im majoring in general biology, which means i have a set number of mandated courses, which includes chemistry 115 and chemistry 215."
"it isn't exactly brain stimulating, but just not being in a learning environment it takes away at the learning experience and educational dynamics."
this curiosity to learn will benefit me in the future because biology is centered around composing experiments and observing the living world.
i've only had one previous encounter with physics before this class and it wasn't a pleasant experience.
"planet?, i don't know but i feel like everyone serves a purpose for there existence and one day even i will know the purpose i am here and what is my purpose of existence."
"i also care greatly about the environment, so when i learned that i could get a job at which i design technology to function on clean energyget to work with renewable energy, i knew it was the career for me."
"i really love biochemistry but some of the requirements, like physics and organic chemistry, arent my favorite requirements."
my first impressions of the class are not so positive because im already confused in my lecture.
"ive been watching movies since i was a child, and the movies that always interested me were those that took place in space or on a foreign planet."
"it wasn't really a choice, but i am not complaining about it."
"for me, being successful means working hard to make what you want to achieve possible, and staying focused on whatever it takes to get to that point."
i guess i am here since i have a physics lab with the coolest instructor.
astronomy is also interesting.
physics gives me a better understanding of how things work in the world and i think that is something that will help give me perspective when i start learning more about what makes the body work.
"i am in sci 335 class because i would like to review the lessons we went through in the chemistry class im already in, chem 335, and have a better understanding of the concepts."
"now talking about in general, i feel like my purpose in this world is to make a positive impact on people s lives."
i love being able to spend time with amazing animals that most people do not think about on a daily basis.
i am taking chemistry classes because i am majoring in biology in physiology as a focus.
part of doing that is taking this physics course and accompanying physics lab.
thats a difficult question to answer.
i moved here to experience new things and meet new people and i think that i have definitely done that and i can't wait to experiencemeet even more peoplethings!
"however, that is not the only reason because on the other hand, physics is my favorite subject.therefore, even in my first semester at sfsu, i chose physics."
one of my best friends back home is also an astronomy minor and enjoys teaching me what i dont understand.
"i have some experience with studying physics before, but it was a long time ago and i've forgotten like most of it."
the bootcamp was the final layer they needed.i had enough employers tell me to go back to school that i decided that was a good plan.
"i am here at san francisco state university, the same reason people go to community."
i had previously struggled with the prerequisite course circuits analysis and had a year gap between so i thought this would be a good course to take for the extra help.
i believe im here to learn and gain more than what i would of it if i was still in socal in both my personal life and school life.
i am planning as of now to keep gallup for next year.
many words that i need more time to understand.
also i'm sorry i didn't turn this in way sooner i switched into your class 2weeks in and i was looking for my response from my last class.
why am i here?it is a really interesting question.
"before this, i sat in a different building in san diego county, at a different school because it was what was expected of me then."
once i had signed up to all the right classes i only needed a couple more to get a full enrollment status.
i also was curious on how calculus was going to be involved with the course.
i have always loved learning and deciding to pursue higher education at sf state was something i had never even thought of.
"we put so many efforts on solving equations, but only went to lab once or twice per semester."
im here to really learn physics so that i dont have to catch up later.
this is super long i really have no idea what else to talk about soooo.
it is very interesting to me and to be more knowledgeable on the matter makes me a better surfer.
"a lot of people, they ask for i don't know something from whatever higher power that they believe in."
to step out of my comfort zone and indulge myself into the unknown of astronomy
"even though i never had the chance to take physics classes before, im here to dip my toes in other stem fields."
"i am here, participating in the general physics laboratory 11210 because it is a prerequisite requirement for my major."
im here at sf state because i wanted to go to a 4 year university and it was the most affordable compared to the other universities i was accepted to.
i also really love nature and animals so i am also thinking about becoming a wildlife biologist.
"i always had a passion for math too, so it just all added up."
in these 3 classes we are talking about velocity at the moment which really helps me grasp more of an understand of the topic taking these courses.
i also like how it is once a week so i was able to fit the class in my schedule.
there's a couple answers to why i am here.
"by taking classes and ultimately earning a degree, i am empowering myself to be able to think critically about the issues we face and find ways to change that reality."
the last time i took physics was maybe 5 or 6 years ago.
"however, that is not the only medical research i would do, i would love to do more than that, thats why i am here."
there is conclusive answers for the most part.
i'm not sure why i need to take this class but i enjoy the stimulation.
shes trying to go to med school and needs all the help she can get.
"so i will get back home at 11 pm and have eaten, do my hw, and other miscellaneous stuff only to wake up at 7:30 am."
i am the type of person that always seek to understand things or how things works.
and for me to do that i have to make money.
i've never taken a physics class before so most of this information is new to me but i find it very interesting.
i am preparing myself in the best way possible by performing to the best of my abilities in all my courses.
the big reason why i chose to come here was also how close it was to home seeing that i only live 20 to 20 minutes away.
"however, i disagree with them on the idea where they say that a degree is useless."
the whole idea of how the earth rotates around the sun psyches me out a little because how the hell did we really get here?
the first and most important reason is because i needed 1 more unit to make full time status for my scholarships after i dropped my internship class.
i have always been fascinated to work in cybersecurity and work with ai. those are the main reason why i am here in this physics lab section so that can obtain my degree.
"now, i have to take this class because it is part of my roadmap of majoring in biology."
"while there are office hours offered, sometimes office hours do not work for my schedule or it is so heavily attended that i only am able to ask one question."
i don't think i'll ever use physics in my field but i have always thought it was rad.
perhaps it's included to require students to round off their major with other subjectsso that students learn about subjects outside of their field.
"it was also great with how the class itself interacted, were if there was anything someone comprehended really well they would try to explain it in another way that we werent told in lecture, or even by the instructors, so there was a variety of ways to break down the information for whomever needed it."
"therefore, this class will give another chance to explore more about the subject."
it's interesting to me and i've always seen electricity as a kind of magic because i really don't know how it gets into my power outlet and then into my toaster.
"this relates to my greater sense of purpose as a human being to gain knowledge throughout my life, because i believe that knowledge is power."
"i wanted to experience new things and be surrounded by a new environment and since i loved going to san francisco as a kid, i chose to go there for school."
"so for this class, i decided to join is for that extra help to understand the material better."
ialso hope to pass the.
i want to go into the stem field because i have been playing games for a long time and that is what got me into programming and creating things.
i am here at sfsu because i am going to school to earn a degree so that i can be successful in my future.
i am here because i messed up in the first two years of college and now i am graduating later than planned.
i barely passed physics because at the time i wasn't taking it seriously and only to hang out with friends.
"ive done most of my stuff on my own and i felt i was capable of overcoming everything alone, but i guess not."
i decided to take sci 111 because i struggled with physics in high school.
the labs for physics are extremely useful in my opinion because they give me a visual representation and they give me a better understanding of the topics.
"even if i switched to another field, i would still need most of the earlier courses anyways, so i was confident in my choice."
"why am i here? there are multiple reasons as to why i am here, and i cant just say one while disregarding the others."
since the major i wanted to do was game design but then i realized that computer science is what can help me get a better future.
katya candray 1 september 2020 professor ghosh physics 112.02 reflective journaling 1 the reason that im here is because i believe that physics is an important subject to learn in order to help us think critically and also to get a basic understanding as to why and how the world works around us.
"i am also here, enrolled in this sci class to help myself ask questions when i am not understanding a concept in physics."
"as a junior in college, and also a commuter i do not have free time for study sessions outside classes that actually fit my schedule and i learn better when materials are repeated and bought to knowledge in groups."
i am here because i wanted to take this class since i am not the best at chemistry and wanted all the help that i can get.
"if physics is going to help me better understand my job and what is going on in the world, i will take my time with it to get there."
i am here because i was careless.
"when i went to physical therapy, my therapist and i got really close during my process of rehabilitation."
i look forward to getting refreshed on some of the material that will be discussed in class.
"you know what, physics is dispensable to me because i dont study it and use it like those scientists."
i am in this class due to it being a prereq for my major which is biology.
"i wish i could understand the material better, and quicker for that matter, but honestly i will take what i can get at this point."
also this semester is kind of different and its a bit challenging since you have to be on the computer and jump into different class and find links for zoom if you don't have the class added.
i am here now to teach my daughter the right and wrong as she gets older.
i am in this physics lab or this university to achieve higher education.
my aim in taking this course to reinforce what i learn in my general physics class through the physical application of theoretical concepts.
"i also feel that physics is a very practical subject; by that, i mean that it can be applied to day to day life and utilized to your advantage whereas calculus not so much."
i consider myself to be a lifelong learner.
"for a few months i was thinking to study rpt, (recreation, parks, and tourism), because that major seems very fun to me and with jobs it could come with."
why am i here?so why am i here in the class sci0115?
"despite this class being a requirement, i hope to gain some knowledge over this topic."
i also would like to be more aleks if it will help me and that way i can stay knowing the foundation.
i fell in love with coding as soon as i began learning it.
we are all here for the same reason.
it is what helps humans push forward in progress and find new frontiers and challenges.
so another reason i am in the class is to better understand physics a topic i have a long history of problems with.
i am in san francisco state because i really love san francisco.
i believe that knowing a little bit of every subject in college is what makes the graduates ready to face life with a good foundation of experiences.
milka abdosh why am i here?
i am interested to know exactly why things work the way they do.
"also, i think physics is just generally interesting and i like to know how the world works and to be able to explain everyday concepts accurately."
physics is a completely new topic for me as i have never taken classes related to this.
the field seemed interesting in high school when i took my first programming class and the pay for new programmers seemed pretty good.
this is my last semester of physics so after that i will hopefully never have to do it again.
i am here in this course because it is going to make me a more successful student and aid my learning.
what is all of our purpose?
"to that my expectations are high, wish me luck."
"however, now i realize that it is important supplemental material for my future in the medical industry."
for example the force of that object or the speed of that ball i would know that i had seen that in physics.
i am in this class because it is part of my required courses.
i am taking physics 240 because it is necessary for my major which is electrical engineering.
"the sci course also helps improve my gpa and gives me an extra unit, so it doesn't hurt to take it."
"however, taking it in college has allowed me to understand it better than i did in high school."
"furthermore, i get to learn and work with likeminded individuals who have similar goals."
this can also help as a place where i can make connections to later be able to get into jobs or even just help each other out.
"i have been doing this ever since i was young; building, creating, and mapping out ideas of invention models on paper."
i think sci is a really good program because they are up to date what teachers are teaching in lecture and continue reviewing those topics.
i am also in this specific sciclass because one of my friends is in this same class.
i am taking not only one but two sci courses this semester.
"since this is a broad paper about why we are here, i'm not sure if were supposed to be talking about here as in physics lab or here as in what our purpose in this world is."
"street racing, or circuit racing....."
i don't quit when there's harder problems.
i ended up dropping a class that was during this class so that i could get help for bio 230 instead of trying to teach myself the information.
i started questioning things around me and i just feel like we're in a simulation.
"these are variations in perspective, ranging between scientific to philosophic."
i chose to be in this course since it allows me to be a step closer to what i want to do or become in the future.
i also really enjoyed physics last semester and knew that i would enjoy this class as well.
"my whole life i was convinced that im bad at math, but im so stubborn that i kind of just decided that im gonna do it whether or not im good at it, because i enjoy it."
the physics course was an overall good experience as well as i remember a lot of problems that were solved with the professor doing presentations.
this course fulfills my physics class requirements and teaches me how to apply methods of using computerinterfaced measurement hardware to programs.
(31) i have taken the lecture class physics 111 the semester before summer classes.
"in the future, i hope that i can still do well and get a great grade."
im here to finish the lab today and get the assignment done for this class.
i just need to know when that will be.
"damarcus johnsonreflection when i think of why im here, my mind goes immediately to my family."
which is interesting since i did all the history ap classes that my school had available as well as ap chemistry and ap biology.
in this class i wish to experiment on cool stuff which can make me better understand the classroom physics.
everyones purpose is different.
you just have to want to do it.
"the more i follow my curriculum, the more i understand why i am in the classes i am."
"but who knows, i cant see the future, and simply rambling to take up pace in this text box."
"in general, there's nothing i can change or do about the fact that i was born, so i guess everyone's purpose would be to make the most out of their lives."
"i did not know how to use the equations correctly and ended up not understanding physics and ultimately failed to grasp the concept of physics and how to calculate forces, torque, and the other things in physics."
i'm in stem to have my requirements met for medical school.i'm currently enrolled in chemistry and physics so i'm more excited to take upper division than lower division.
"i didn't think i could do that back home, because home was a comfortable spot for me and i needed to be pushed out of my comfort zone."
i need flexible hours.
i had to take advantage of the chance of getting an education.
physics has a lot to do with why the earth works the way it does and why certain natural things happen.
"when i initially think of ""why am i here?"" i initially think it is just to fulfill a major requirement."
"although, i took physics a couple years ago so i would need a refresher on some of the material."
since i already have the credits of a junior ill graduate as a super senior or sadly.
maybe i might even use this skill in the future.
i enjoy the chemistry sci classes because they provide extra help and help me make study groups.
im not smart enough.
im thinking high ceilings at least 10 feet and so much air conditioning you need a jacket.
it's within my understanding that this is similar to physics.
this is something i must complete before moving forwards with it.
a class specifically for studying and really understanding the concepts that are being thrown at us is exactly what i need because if im going to make it through as a biology major i need to learn everything for comprehension and not just for memorization.
i am also here to learn about the meaning of life and how things around us work.
there is other ways but i don't know anything about like starting my own business and i don't personally have the capital or credit to be able to venture out on my own so an education will eventually facilitate that.
"in conclusion, the more knowledge the better."
as the world transitions to more automation there is going to be more jobs that require the skills that i am currently learning.
i am taking these courses in order to graduate and receive a college degree.
i am taking this sci class to give myself more practice so ill be more prepared for exams and the material in general in class.
i got a low grade my last semester of my senior year in ap physics and it wrecked my gpa which got my acceptance revoked by the ucs i got into.
"i have a general idea of the concept of physics but i am sure throughout this class, that will change."
"after taking different classes in community college, i found myself very interested in the kinesiology field and i remember watching a short clip in class about the different career paths."
it is a general education requirement for us students to take a lab class with one of the science classes of our choice.
i just need twentythree more wordseighteen now.
"in the original physics section i had, this was not the case."
one of the most interesting versions i've heard was that we were all angels that lost our ways and we are living many lives in order to fix the mistakes that weve made and in the different life times that we live we are learning different lessons and once we've learned all our lessons that's when we can finally fully rest.
"this means that i cannot waste my life and have to live my life to the fullest, whether that be doing something that i love for the rest of my life or just experiencing new things and having fun in general."
"i was able to handle the course work during middle and high school, and the subject matter made was more practical and made more sense to me than other subjects."
i do not want to lie and say that this is not also my goal.
things kinda suck but itll pass i guess.
i wanted to experience a new environment and a new schooling system.
"i am sitting here, in this building, at this school because it is what is expected of me and i am okay with that."
i am here because i put it off to the last second.
"but then for so long i struggled with school, with wanting to finish school etc."
i cant understand the subject even though its the beginning of the semester.
i wanted to get comfortable before pushing myself with how much work i was able to handle.
i never thought about this question before or how i am suppose to answer.
"the reason why i am in the physics lab is because the lecture itself cannot be done without a lab, and vice versa."
"so, knowing from past sci classes, i knew that i needed to add this class to make sure that i dont fall behind and end up getting a bad grade."
"i am here because out of all the schools i applied to ( i applied to about 4 schools) this was the school that i got accepted to, and i can say that coming up here has changed my perspective of so many things, i've learned so much more than what i would have learned staying in my home area."
"last semester, about the time when math 199 class was almost ending, i heard that the next step, physics 111, would be much more tough than the current class."
i am at san francisco state university because it is at home.
"after i have taken the pervious physics classes, i feel now the labs are not that awful as i would expect."
although i really don't like physics but i do enjoy doing experiments in labs and better understand the material.
i am experiencing things here that i would have never learned about myself in socal.
another reason i am here is to develop critical thinking and problem solving skills used when solving a problem.
i am taking physics 111 because it fulfills my requirement for general education.
"sci usually gives me tips, tricks, and a lot of practice for what i need to know to succeed."
the interconnected aspect of the body that moves as a unit is deeply fascinating to me.
there can only be more that can be learned and can benefit me.
"for researching as a biologist, i think it might be very hard but fun to do something that you are passionate about."
coming from southern california i wanted to go far from home but not out of the state.
"bio is not easy for me at all, i like it, but it has been one of the hardest subjects for me since high school."
being in the lab gives me opportunities to learn more about various topics i have learned during the semester and have a better understanding of what i have learned in the past.
"after getting my bachelor of science degree in kinesiology, i plan to hopefully apply for physical therapy school or occupational therapy school."
i also want to graduate early to save money speaking of which i just remembered i have a lot of scholarships i need to apply for.
i knew that i was pretty bad with science as a subject since i was little.
i think its vital to feel a class interesting.
"in astronomy, you get to learn more about constellations and also makes you question things that you never thought about."
i am here for a list of reasons.
i do not expect myself to know everything but i know that i do have my resources and instructors who can help me.
one common example of how physics is relevant to us is how cars move.
"the alternatives to being a scientist were to be a nurse, doctor, or a bit of a disappointment."
"i am here because of my friends, whom gave me confidence, happiness, and love."
i don't know if this question is pertaining to why am i here at san francisco state university or why am i here in this class.
"from there on, i plan to gain work experience, and live on my own off of my future career."
i've never been a big fan of physics as a student and especially when i had taken ap physics in high school.
ive wanted to learn more for physics and i am hoping its interesting like chem class.
"i know i cant singlehandedly solve anything, change only happens if we all contribute to it so id rather try and be a contributor rather than not."
"from xray, ct scans, and mri, all came from an understanding of physics and how electromagnetic fields work and such."
my purpose is change and enlightenment.
"the amount that is left to discover in our oceans excites me, just to be apart of those discoveries."
this class is also probably a prereq for another class that i will need to take.
i attend sf state because out of the many schools i applied to it was either here or csu eastbay and sf state didn't seem too bad in comparison.
"i hope that by the end of this semester that i can get a better grade than without the sci classes help, and be able to go into physics 2 with confidence and the knowledge needed to do well there as well."
i have no idea to be honest .
"i am a transfer student, and my major is marine biology."
i decided to drop this class last semester so that i could just focus on chemistry and pass the chemistry class.
again i hope this works out.
"with all that being said, i actually enjoy this class (lecture) so far because of the instructor."
"if its possible, i might choose astronomy as my minor major in sfsu. im here to learn more things that i havent know about astronomy, so i can decide should i choose astronomy as my minor major."
"but people fresh out of high school generally don't have the right mindset to get good software engineering work done, that's why degrees take 3 (or 4) years."
"san francisco just happened to be one of the cheapest options for me at the time because going to college can be very expensive, but i would not have changed my whole experience for the world."
"i think there is something planned for me, for all of us as to why we are here."
i gain from working with peers and i love teaching others and seeing their eyes light up with understanding.
"i know i still feel like i'm at the bottom sometimes, but i've taken the first intuitive into being able to accomplish that goal."
that's why i'm here.
but not in stereotypical ways.
"ive lived near a city, los angeles to be exact, and sometimes i regret not staying in southern california to pursue my career."
"for this reason, i plan to take all the prerequisites for med school."
i hopefully will figure out more of my purpose at sf state the longer i'm here.
other than the fact that most people are expected to go to college in their families i think that there could be other reasons as to why people go to college and that is because college is a brainstorming environment.
some people i know recommend taking them separately to pace myself.
"despite being a science major, i do not have a natural proclivity for the parent class."
this scared me a little but i knew coming to college was the choice i had to make to get into my career.
"its specially difficult to affirm oneself during this period we are experiencing because of the whole virus situation, but the one thing that i have learned from learning in this new format is how important resilience is."
another reason i chose to go to sf state is because i love the cold weather.
"going to college is an amazing experience not only for learning but to make connections, friends, and making memories."
because of these reasons i decided to take sci 111 class during this semester.
"but i need to pass this class in order to graduate, so i will have to do my best and give my all."
"also, its at night so instead of wasting that time in doing nothing i now have something to do."
"in reality, i always come back to the same thing, the reason i am here is to learn."
i honestly don't know how this course will help me for my future goals or careers.
in the end i would want to leave a legacy so my kids know that i did my work on this planet and to influence them to want to leave their mark.
i'm here to make myself content as i can be and to travel.
we have different thoughts and opinions on things which is why we crash too much so when we take turns with her we go by what we were taught.
another main reason why i need the knowledge from this class is in order to take the mcat i need physics in my academic background.
"lastly, i hope i am able to learned from the labs and have the professor help the entire class throughout the lab as a whole group."
"as far as physics, i am somewhat familiar with basic material since i took this course in high school."
it also shows me that we are all struggling with something.
"i would like to do well in the course and i have heard that the supplemental instruction courses are very helpful and that students who take these courses, on average, do better in the actual class in comparison to students who dont take the sci course."
those are some of the reasons on why i am here and why i am enrolled in taking the physics 102 lab.
i actually dont exactly know why i am here.
its pretty mellow here and theres a bunch of educated hipsters who attend this university.
i knew that i need help for this class because what i am studying is new for me.
and because i came into existence on the only known planet to support life.
i feel like i often ask myself this question but lets see.
i am here because last semesters sci course was extremely beneficial to me.
"since science is with us everyday in life, and we could discovered them based on different principle."
you can just work hard and succeed.
it will also be interesting to see if i use physics in the medical profession in some way or another.
regardless of that i hope this semester is way different and changes my perspective on physics.
i would also like to help those in need of medical attention and help them to live a nice healthy life.
i want to learn new things that i never knew before.
"i am not pursuing this career just for the money, i also love learning about the human body, i find it very interesting."
"if the labs were a little clearer, i feel like i would enjoy coming to class more too."
i only had 10 or so credits so i needed one more class.
i am here because i am majoring in biology.
calculus 2 is a required course to major in mechanical engineering and failing calculus 2 will severely impact my college road map.
"i don't really enjoy physics because it really confuses me, and it's going to be especially hard with it being online."
"overall, i am excited to be in this class to further my knowledge about what physics is about and to help me out with the lecture portion of it."
i desire to begin to grasp the the balance of matter...
even though this class is a requirement and i must complete it for my major i do not look at it that way.
experiments carried out in physics laboratories helps students in learning how to be patient and attentive while using observation and before calculating the result.
"i am here in this class because my major requires it, as well as phys 2, i hope to enjoy the things we will learn here."
i felt very isolated in that school and felt like there were not enough programs to get involved in.
i think that i need to learn how to self facilitate extra time to study and review in.
im using my time wisely and getting rid of the classes that i can take here that transfer over.
yes they did encourage and force me to choose my major but i do find interest in it.
and i don't think anyone actually knows a definite answer considering there is no actual difference between me and the next person we are still on this same planet.
i dont want to just get by my class i want to learn and apply the things i have learned to the world.
"since i was planning on being an astrophysics major astronomy is not that far off from that in my opinion, so im perfectly fine with it."
that was my favorite thing to do back home in the sunny weather because its too gloomy and cold up here.
i enrolled in physics 112 laboratory because i wanted to be able to take it the same time as my physics 111 lecture.
in which i can learn from them as well from their tactics.
i often think that i dont need to live up to everyones expectations and i can just do what i want and live on.
i've come here to become someone who knows what he's doing.the majority of my time as a student has been characterized by a lack of motivation to be proactive in my studies.
i hope to learn many things from you and convert everything that i do learn into my every day life.
so because of that i am very new to physics all i know about physics is that a lot of it has to do with math which i am somewhat comfortable with and i know there are formulas that i will need to understand what they do and how to apply them to a problem.
"in this present moment, i am building myself up through education and experiences so that later in my life, i will be able to contribute to the personal growth of others and help them through their endeavours."
i have always had a passion for hands on work and an affinity for math and physics.
and also potluck!!
i didn't realize this until i got my feet wet with sci for chem 115.
i focus more on the human body and life.
the reason i am here is because i am continuing my path as a biology major.
i am here for an endless amount of reasons.
i am currently a pre bio major planning to concentrate in physiology.
in order to be able to invent anything i know i need to understand the physics behind it.
"god put everyone on this earth to live freely, but with a purpose."
"however, i know i cant continue to tech forever."
also all the other sections for this class i have conflicts so it wouldn't work out.
i am here because i have failed my second semester of physics because i didnt learn anything.
i have no idea what i'm going to be doing after this but for now i'm here feeling like i'm doing something productive.
i have several cousins that have a ba but that is all.
"now that i think about it, learning is pretty fun and i don't want to stop learning forever."
i hope i can make it through so i can fulfill this dream.
she saw it as a massive waste of my time and future were i to pursue it further.
the teachers this year in both my classes seem to be very enthusiastic which will further my learning experience.
"people might say it is prerequisite to situs their major, and so on."
for the reasons i listed above and for more that do not come to mind right now that is why i am here.
"this was the most interesting to me because of the research i could do, and the things i can accomplish."
"in a household where sometimes i would not have the luxury of having to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner."
i know that this class is necessary for me to become a competitive student when time comes for me to apply to graduate school.
it really works out my brain and keeps me occupied.
"i recognized that i wasnt a genius like many of my peers, but that i was still capable of learning at my own pace, and that was perfectly fine."
i really enjoyed all the classes for phys 220 but now i feel that i am having a hard time with phys 230.
working as an electrical engineer will hopefully provide me with the income necessary for me to live the lifestyle i would want to live.
"so far, i think my decision has been paying off."
i wouldnt bother to try to explain because ive accepted one true fact that we all can live with: im here right now because i have to be.why am i here right now?
"successfully, i achieved my aa degree of science liberal arts."
it was my choice.
"otherwise, i am not able to love someone."
i enjoy it because it is forced studying in a productive manner.
examples could be the lab experiments we will be undergoing throughout the semester to help further my understanding in my lecture class and my own knowledge.
i am hoping that the information i learn in this class will really sink in because i am taking physics 2 next semester and i assume that this information will be useful andor needed.
"right now, i feel that place is a spacious apartment where i have a dog and a career somewhere with four seasons and lots of greenery and i am happy and stable and healthy."
i do not have a particular interest in physics its self but i do find physics fascinating.
"if i were to choose any subject, science would by my number one choice because there is science behind everything in everyday life."
"she would sleep in all day, sometimes forget english and only german."
i am here because i would like to learn more about astronomy.
"not everyone can attend college to make a good life out of them,fortunately i am attending college and am really thankful for this opportunity."
i am taking eighteen units and that is really brutal especially when it is so stem heavy.
i am here for my third time and am motivated and confident in passing this course as well as actually understanding the subject.
i signed up for 2 sci classes this semester because in the past sci courses have really improved my learning.
at the same time you have the ability to critically think rather than have a mindless job.
"however, i am looking forward to learn physics so that i can apply to what i do in the future."
physics has always been a subject i have had trouble with.
thank you :)
"for this question, there are many ways that i interpret it."
"therefore, i am not a huge fan of physics."
why am here?i am here because i am a civil engineering student here at san francisco state university.
i was struggling on choosing college schools when i was in high school.
i am taking this course to increasebetter my understanding of the concepts that i am learning in class.
having lower levels of stress will help me live a happier life which is the ultimate goal.
the particular reason why i specifically chose a physics course rather than other science courses is because i wanted to kind of witness the application of calculus in the real world at a much higher level than how the applications were taught in calculus.
i believe that through this course i can learn a lot that can be applied to my major and help me succeed in that aspect.
"i'm here at this institution becauase in order to do what i want to be when i grow up, i need a college degree."
walking down the streets of oakland to catch the bart from fruitvale bart station can be very exciting since i know all this physics things.
why am i here in san francisco?
other than that i chose to take physics because i took it in high school and i really enjoyed it.
i am here in this class because i have to take it as a class for my major.
i wanted to make changes to ultimately lead to a better career and a better future for me and my family.
"i have been to several tutoring centers and extra help in school, but never seem to fully understand the concepts in physics."
reflective journal 1hello!
i can see physics being beneficial to me in my major because kinesiologists analyze movement and with that you need to understand physics.
anything is possible as long as you believe in yourself.
i am here in this class because i need extra help in the bio class.
why am i here in my room doing school work instead of on the campus?
"plus, i believe that some of our best work and learning is done in groups, so i think the actual class concept of working in groups will also be beneficial."
"i believe we are all here for a reason, and whether it may be right or wrong i believe it is noble."
i want to enable people with important information to be able to share it with those who need to hear it.
and i think it is useless in our daily life.
i have hope though!
"""why am i here""."
"by having this class, i know that it will hold me accountable to do things like my class work and to even get in study time when i know that i do not have the energy to do it at home."
"for learning physics, it's easier for me to understand the concept when i see the instructors working out physics problems and explaining how to solve it or the thought process of solving a physics problem."
"from things to pergolas to houses, i just love being able to understand how and structure is design to withstand certain loads and meeting certain design criteria."
i want to go into the stem field because i've been around it my whole life.
theres always space to open your doors for more room for knowledge.
"i took physics in high school and did some hands on stuff, like creating an electric field through the connections of different electric charges."
i realized that asking questions about it is helpful too.
"my parents were not able to go to college, so they have always worked in really hard jobs that only pay the minimum."
my purpose is to brighten the lives of others.
"but then there's physics, which seems to always give me a little trouble."
i do everything for him and i cannot wait to finish and show him i did it.
i went to high school in la and i chose to go to sf state is because it is close to the silicon valley and my father said it is very easy to find a job there based on my major.
"although the class has been proving to be a little difficult, i believe that with enough time i will excel in this class."
"its another tool in my belt, and a pillar of stability."
"phys 230 232, however, is emphasized on electricity and electromagnetism, which i feel that computer scientists, who mainly focus on software, do not need to know."
"by this, i mean that this is literally a class that can help me succeed."
my biggest fear is to be filled with regrets in old age.
all of it is intertwined.
i also think that people do struggle a lot with it and i enjoy the challenge of it.
that's a good question.
i am here because i hope to be successful and pursue my goals in being a scientist especially within the research industry.
another reason why i feel like im here is to further my education and career .
"i barely passed that class, and put little to no effort learning in o chem 1 because the teacher was lenient and gave me a passing grade to be nice."
it took working at a research and development style private sector startup to realize i particularly enjoy studying virology.
i enjoy learning new things everyday.
"honestly, i have no idea what career or major i want to pursue, so i cant really complain about this."
most jobs require a specific college degree in order for them to hire you to work for them.
"sometimes, i feel as if i am here simply to be an aid to others."
"since physics is basically another math class, i knew i would need to take extra steps to ensure my success."
"and when aleks tries to tell me about the tools, they dont fully explain on how to use them, i still end up lost."
i hope that in taking this class i will be able to understand the material i may be too timid to ask about in the classroom.
college has always been my first choice of what i would do after high school.
"this class will help me one step closer to graduating, and that is why i am here."
i am a biochemistry major because i love learning about chemistry; the molecular world has always fascinated me.
"otherwise, i could have actually skipped this class if i had taken the ap test for ap physics, as i took this class in junior year of high school."
plus it has a beautiful campus in the middle of the city where everything is closeby.
im in sci because i need the tools to help me graduate and do my very best.
"to break my educational experience into parts, after high school i transferred into a community college (de anza college) and stayed there for 3 years."
"but im here to try to pass the class this semester, i feel good about this class."
"also, i would want to study the animals behavior and how they interact with each other."
i need a minimum of 200.
its hard but its the one subject that doesnt hurt to study for.
taking this class will help me explore this field and have a better understanding of the lecture.
i am studying to hopefully enter dental school and i do like science.
i have little to no interest in this class.
"i took a physics class in high school and did well on it, but i had to work very hard."
"no matter at what age i am in, i know that wherever i am in life it is because of my choices, god, and it is because i was meant to be there."
i am taking physics and physics lab because i really interested in learning how physics works and how the dynamic of physics.
i am here to help the environment!
i find the field to be very interesting to me and i can see myself enjoying it for the rest of my life.
"i would say i'm here because this class is required by my major, but i failed this class twice before."
i am in this class because it is a requirement for my major and a prerequisite for several upper division courses i need to take.
the current basics.
this has been a dream of mine for a while and i have stuck to it ever since it became just an idea in my head.
my name is tamir rasheed and thats why im here
"however, since i am required to take this class i might as well try to understand and learn how we could use physics in the real world."
"to me, phys 220 was important to learn and to know about, since it teaches you about gravity, some calculus based equations that would be helpful and necessary for computer scientists, and allow students to understand how to properly form questions, solutions, and better thought processes that can translate from physicists to computer scientists."
i am in college for a number of reasons.
"thus, i would confidently say my learning capability and performance has been greatly affected by staying at home."
"""why am i here?"" i am in san francisco because i wanted to get out of high school a year early, and specifically, l.a., where i grew up."
it does not matter with me to do all assignment to gain better and better atmostphere of the class.
"it will help me solidify the course material to do well in class, provide a support group, and allow for extra study time while still earning credit thus bringing my gpa up a little bit which can make a big difference."
"the common trope is life is based on biology which is based on chemistry, which is based on physics, which is based on math."
"i think it is worth it, it's a chill class for me to work on chem 215 with great people on a relaxing friday."
"i come here to achieve the skills needed to solve physics problems, all sorts."
ive been in school for a little too long so im hoping that my general shortcomings dont impact this last semester in terms of engaging with the class or absorbing the material.
"im here because its a required class for my major, to be honest!"
i would like to use my background in a way that allows me to me travel and connect with many different people from differing cultures and really gain a broader view on life.
"for me personally, i am taking physics 101 and 102, because as a kinesiology major it is something that we need to know in our field of study."
another reason i am taking sci bio 240 is because it makes me feel good and comfortable.
i also need a certificate to get into dentistry school.
"i am the type of person who needs to really have a one on one and have detailed notes in able to understand, which this class brings."
then it struck me that i want to work in the video game industry to help in any way possible.
"these things are like converting units, calculating speed, velocity, acceleration, etc."
school is not about just participation and attending to do minimally get good grades.
"at times ill find the temporary answer to that question, but never fully understanding the answer i come up with."
"without having general physical knowledge, i will not be able to accomplish my education goal in the kinesiology major, or graduate program in the future."
he was very obnoxious and acted like he was still in a fraternity although he was 10 years my senior.
i'm in this physics class mostly because it's a requirement to graduate.
i am in this class because i am not good at math.
i find physics to be the hardest subject for me to understand.
originally i didnot think that i would survive physics and i didnt for lecture but now here i am in physics 2.
reflecting back its crazy to think that i am living in san francisco and going to school at sf state.
"also, i can be here to try to make the world a better place."
im 'iustus trying et muros hos gradus est ultimum cursum et related scientia semper est accipere prius non sum liber.
i walked here from my apartment at university park north.
college is feel is a big stepping stone for young people such as myself and i think it can get you through many doors that would otherwise be closed with a college degree.
such as forces acting on an object.
i am taking sci to expand my understanding of physics.
since grad schools require the full year of general physics and other science courses i must fulfill the requirements to let alone be viewed as a possible candidate.
but i didnt let that stop me from catching up in school and celebrating special occasions with my family.
staying in the dorms is a special kind of hell.
this is something i have struggled with.
i grew up having so many different types of pets so i grew to love animals.
i have never taken a physics class.
i have learned that i am capable of more than i thought i was.
"the truth is, if we lose sight of our purpose, we might lose the opportunity to achieve whatever it is that we want to accomplish in life."
"giovanni ramirez phys 112 february 19th, 2020 reflective journal 1 why am i here?"
"the math and wording has a big cause in that, and not to mention it doesn't really catch my attention."
physics class and lab is a required course that i must take in order for me to graduate with a biology degree.
"but either way, this class is a necessity."
"however, working always seems so much easier, you earn money, and set your hours, and theres no stress on homework or reading."
"my purpose is to learn, gain knowledge, help others, and grow from experiences."
"im honestly glad she did, i feel as though ive gained more confidence and ive found that i like being independent."
i also needed one more unit to become a full time student.
it's also a new learning experience since it's an online lab course where we get to use different methods.
"maybe because most of biology student tend to have a path in medicine and they need physics to understand maybe some biomechanics, similar of how medical students need to know calculus to understand and learn how to read the ecg waves."
i am also hoping that i can understand the world around me a bit better and that i enjoy working in the stem field so that the work i put in towards my major wouldn't be a waste.
oh also thank you for the snacks i was really hungry and you guys came in clutch with the food too.
when i began college i was unsure about which major to pursue.
i already dropped a class since i wasn't confident on doing well.
"i've been told i can do anything i put my mind to but how am i supposed to figure out my true purpose if i can do ""everything""?"
i had no idea that the state offered sci courses and i didn't take advantage of it.
college of ethnic studies and because its local.
"ive always loved science and astronomy growing up but never really ventured outside of elementary, middle, high school classes."
i enjoy taking this lab majority of the time while at other moments it seems frustrating but thats only because i am learning.
"theoretically, it is considered to be the supporting role for me to digest the physics concepts which i learned from 230."
"most importantly, i am here because of my fiancee, jordan."
if i had the chance to not take it i would.
"i don't have to be working because i don't have any bills to pay, so why am i working?"
i feel like astronomy has always been fun for me to learn and know more than any other type of science.
the reason why i am here is because it takes me one step closer to my goal.
with a small background that only includes a highschool physics course i feel ill prepared.
i am here at sfsu for a better future.
it means being set with a job that im highly unlikely to be laid off from.
i chose to attend san francisco state university because it is closest to home other than city college and i went to school right next to state at lowell high school.
"as the pace starts to pick up, i find sci to be somewhat useful."
i would say the main reason i'm here in school is to learn.
i was curious about planets and constellations.
"are we discussing why i choose to be in this class, why i choose to study online, or why i am who i am, where i am?"
the next reason i am here is due to the fact that this class is only one unit and i thought to my self why not to take it.
i hope that this course helps to keep me up to date with the material gone over in class.
that especially helps me learn because handson learning is the best type of learning in my opinion.
i also want to make a lot of money.
"in the end, i am here for nothing."
i came here to sf state because my first intended major (prenursing) was very hard to get into so i decided to look at other jobs and pharmacy really caught my eye.
it is really beneficial that this course functions as a tutoring session and provides units as credit for spending time in the class.
"i was thinking about studying abroad in the united states, so i will be able to learn latest technologies about mechanics and also it. the reason of why i chose san francisco, not la, nyc...etc, is san francisco is one of the biggest cityarea about high technologies."
also i am here because i am going to apply to ucsf so i need as in all my classes.
i almost always need extra help when it comes to mathematic heavy classes after high school.
however i do enjoy learning about stuff i am interested like astronomy and film.
i don't really do well with being told to do something.
the reason i am here in this specific class is because i previously taken biology 230 which is quite embarrassing to say.
"for example, when i got my first ever computer, i was so fascinated by how it can do literally anything i ""command"" to it."
"if you ask me why am i in this class, i would say i need to class to fulfill my ge requirement, but this is not the only reason because there are other lab class that i can choose to fulfill my ge requirement."
i have been working retail for 5 years now and i know that type of career is not for me that is why i am trying to better my education and pursue something that i enjoy and i am interested in.
though it sounds as if i had aimlessly directed myself through classes i had actually gained a lot of knowledge about myself as a student and received several associates degrees in the process.
"even though we all are in different classes learning somewhat different materials, it still all interconnect with each other."
"i am here because it is a pre requisite for my major, biology."
"i am fascinated by how physics works in the world, so i am also taking this course for my major and my own interest."
"last semester, i did not have the time in my schedule for a biology lab, so i had to take a lab for physics instead."
in lab you are able to work with electricity and magnetism physically and manipulate things to see how they go.
"as to why im here as an sfsu student, im actually a transfer student from a local community college."
i am taking sixteen units therefore i should be studying sixteen hours a week.
i'm going to assume the question of why i am here is related to being in this class.
when a body is in motion many forces are acting upon them.
i am here because i really want to be able to understand physics and the mechanics of it.
taking one thing at a time is good for me to focus and prioritize on one task at a time if i get too overwhelmed by multiple deadlines.
"the real question is, what is your reason for being."
i got into stem program because it always interested me and i like knowing how everything connects and work together as a whole since all of these classes connect in a certain way.
i am a second year prebiology major.
another reason why i am here taking physics is because i have always been interested in the topic.
"i am only able to be ""here"" because of them."
this lab is also an opportunity for me to make friends and improve my ability to communicate.
"i chose mechanical engineering because i have some personal experience with automotive repair and maintenance, and have always been a visual and physical learner."
"i actually hated science in high school, but later became intrigued as i got into college."
so i believe am here to make error in my life to know the disguise what i want.
i always knew what i wanted to study and go to college.
i want to dive into the stem field because i love science and technology.
i would say that careful consideration also went into those decisions.
i feel like physics is constantly changing and evolving which is pretty cool in my opinion.
physics doesnt click to methe way it does to others.
but taking this level of physics isnt too bad.
"in so many ways, as cheesy and campy as it sounds, i think its my fate."
"the purpose of life for most living things is to stay alive as long as possible, whether if they have a conscious or not."
obstacles that felt impossible took over my life and made me go off course.
i am excited to continue with this lab and continue to notice these physics concepts throughout my day to day life.
i am here because two people had sex and one of them pushed me out of her vaginal canal.
an important part in physics is that scientists have derived their theories into equations to show how physics work in life.
i believe that the best way to achieve this goal is to through an education.
i love this school because it makes me feel like i belong here.
but i am also here because it simply is not enough to just talk about theory of physics in class.
physics vocabulary isn't incredibly difficult for me because its like learning a new language for me but there are plenty of equations that i have trouble memorizing.
"in order to be fully enrolled my major, i need to meet few prerequisites and one fo them is physics 111112."
i am here because its a required lab for getting further ahead in my degree.
"knowing that this is a class that supports my organic chemistry class, i feel like i can ask for any confusions without being shy."
"i took this class so i would not have to take a lab next semester if i passed, and it would be better to take a lab and a regular science class together rather than take the lab by itself because i might forget about the concepts learned in the regular science class and have difficulty in the lab by itself as a result."
i also want to go into the stem field because of how diverse the work can be.
"not only that, physics i can help me in the long run by providing the many resources to teach me how to use sensors to record and calculate physics experiments."
i was guided to solve problems correctly and more efficiently after just one class.
"i have always been interested in physics and to see how to construct experiments that incorporate different concepts, but always too afraid because i feel like i am bad at math."
but in more of a metaphysical sense...
also it is relatively close to my home here in the east bay of california.
it is also a discipline of importance to other disciplines.
i am here plainly because i need to take this class for my major.
"i explore different ways of deriving a solution that gives the same output, and relish in methodically documenting my work and improving my code."
im here in sci240 because i took sci230 and that class helped me to understand and clear up my confusions that i had in bio230.
i love virology.
i enjoy trying new things and ive never taken a physics course before.
this used to bring me down at times and made me believe that i couldn't succeed in anything i do.
"i think everything happens for a reason, so there must be something to get out of this class."
"i usually like science courses, usually biological science courses, but hopefully this physics course will be fun, i am looking forward to some of the labs."
"to appreciate all the unique backgrounds, cultures and experiences."
"as a senior this semester, i am trying to have a chill last semester and this class is a little more stressful than i would want (with all the quizzes), but i do need to graduate."
having an education opens up doors that you would not be able to access if you didnt have an education.
"typically i would say academics do not come easy to me, but when i work hard and stay on top of things, i find that i do extremely well."
"this is my first physics course, so i am nervous with how it will go as the lecture portion appears to be moving quickly (or maybe i'm still trying to settle in)."
i decided i wanted to be a vet or ta least a vet tech almost only a year ago.
how to navigate using the north star polaris.
"ironically, it's not the only lowerdivision class that i did not take for a computer science major; i have to enroll in a linear algebra class as well as another math class."
"i never really knew what i wanted to be when i was growing up, but then during high school i realized that i like doing math."
"i have always been interested in how stuff has been made as a child, and i think it would be very neat to make machines that can do the work for other people, just like what i saw as a kid from t.v shows and museums."
so far the sci class is really helping me as it allow me to have a general ideas of possible questions and topics that might be appear on the exam.
"in addition, i am here in this specific class because it fits in best with my schedule and i am required to take it."
i no longer have an apartment or a schedule really and it has been difficult.
"overall, i feel like i have many reasons and ways to answer why am i here but those are just a few to mention."
im here because many people my age are in college working towards their dream jobs but i feel like im just here.
its very important that i take physics lab so i can expand and gain new experiences for myself and for medical school.
this is currently my second year at san francisco state university.
it's something that i have always felt was a part of me.
"one thing that motivates me to also get a stem degree is knowing that i am a double minority in this field, since i am both a woman and a person of color."
"i had filled out the csu general app and thought, why not click the sfsu box?"
physics is so essential to us in even the smallest ways yet we dont even realize it because we typically assume that physics is such a complicated concept about motion.
san francisco state has provided me with the opportunity to get a degree in a field i believe i could not find in other places.
the why for me is always bigger than just the material and what looks good on my resume.
i am here in this 9:00am lab course because i was lucky enough to have gotten an add code from my lecture instructor which is allowing me to stay in the lab.
"my physics lab has been difficult to participate in because i have not taken a physics class before and therefore, have no prior knowledge to any of the formulas used in the class."
im at san francisco state university because i chose to go to college at a place close enough to home for me to be able to commute and still get to explore a new area.
i did not have a chance to take in high school since it was full.
"lastly, i am here because i enjoy learning new things and the concept of physics is very interesting to me."
why am i here at sfsu?
i feel that this lab is going to enhance my understanding of physics by engaging in hands on learning and completing activities that are clearly representing the concepts that we learn in phys 101.
"however, i dont know its weird because i have the formulas and can understand the basis of the problem but can never really answer those hard physics problems i faced in physics 111."
lol. i am super new to this subject and i think i should have not judged it before taking the actual course.
i loved how lovely the city is and how convenient transportation is.
how did i come to be here?
since that semester my gpa has not been as good.
but i am happy with the choice i made and hope they continue offering sci classes.
"the class i am taking concurrently with physics is anatomical kinesiology and in that class we also went over newtons first, second and third law to understand forces acting upon the body."
i guess that's a question i ask myself pretty frequently.
"it was unfortunate that covid hit and we cant be on campus to do so, but i am still grateful that professors have made the effort to change the curriculum to fit the online learning."
im taking 17 units so i feel like i could get really caught up and get lost or slack in my classes so i took all the sci classes i could so i could designate a for sure time to study for my class.
but it was the course i most remember as being frustrating and hard to understand.
my major is biochemistry and i have taken many prerequisites to complete my major.
"im specifically in this class because, first, i enjoy the atmosphere that the professor provides to the class and second, to apply the physic concepts to a demonstrative aspect."
i chose this school because of the city and the constant chilly weather.
"i want to make sure that the concepts i learn in my parent course, are reinforced in the sci class so that i have a good understanding of them."
there are a lot of factors that have influenced where i am today.
i'm here because i chose to be here.
i work better in groups than myself because i feel like different opinions and ways can help me understand how to solve the problem.
i along with most believe my purpose is something greater than what's expected.
"i wanted to be in this class because i think astr is a very fun subject, and i can know more about our planet and the earth, etc.."
i need to take this particular physics class because i am a biology major and also because i was nervous about taking ap physics in high school and decided not to do it.
"ever since i was a child i loved going on top of the roof of the house and look up at the night sky and try to find constellations, or watch the solarlunar eclipse, and watching the meteor showers as well, and ever since then i have always wanted to learn more about what is out there and that is why i have joined this class, that is why i am here."
i am here because i wan to pass calculus because if i don't then i am not going to be able to move further in my career.
if i had strong method for learning on my own i wouldn't be here.
"i only hope that i will be able to finish the lab, understand what i did, and write a decent report sooner rather than later so that i will be able to leave early than the lab's official end time.i don't really have any extra thoughts to add to this reflective journaling, as i don't believe that i will have any worries about my subjects until i get further into my discipline and go through more higherlevel courses as opposed to this introductory course.overall, this is my first year here at the college, so i am hoping that i might start to like it more as time goes on."
i also am in this class to gain knowledge about physics of course.
humans are not properly taking care of this earth and that needs to be changed.
or understanding why the clock ticks a certain way with the use of batteries.
i'm trying to change the system so people can do whatever they want so they all have their own tasteful personality.
"in order to progress and graduate with my ba in marine biology and limnology, i have to take these courses."
"physics, per se, is fundamental and hence prerequisite, giving high impacts on our life."
the time that i had spent in this class made me want to go outside and look at the sky more often.
what is existence?
i am inspired and encouraged by all the dentists in my office.
i ask myself that question every day for about maybe the past 5 years.
i am here because i want to take advantage of the extra support that is available for math 227.
someone has to write it down or draw it for me to imagine what some type of problem looks like.
im here to help me with o chem 2.
"plus we never know when the world is going to end or how its going to end, so we might as well learn about it."
but other than that i know this class will be hard and i just have to be open to making more time for my studies.
i know that nothing in life ever comes easy but i feel like i am really struggling and i am just about ready to throw on the towel.
"this is because protons and electrons want to connect with each other, forming bonds."
"i know i may not be super passionate about stem it's still fascinating the things that i am learning in my stem major and to hope that maybe one day i will be a women coding those supercomputers, or creating a software for a big company, or maybe just maybe creating and app that will go viral one day who knows."
another reason is i have no place in the world of science but in art for the human race has the power to create.
sfsu is also a great school so it works out.
"coincidentally, i was thinking of one of my favorite web shows while reading this question: red vs blue."
"im still thinking about it, but psychology might be a better option for me."
"speaking as myself without any occupation of any sort, i just want to love others and make them feel like they're worth a lot."
"it took a long time for me to accept that, and come to terms with my decision to go to community college."
even though learning can be taught be anyone.
physics lab reflective journal 1why am i here?i am here because it is a class that i need to take in order to get my degree.
i hope to get knowledge from this class that will better prepare myself for the kinesiology courses i will be needing to take next school year.
planning ahead is always fun but i have to take it one step at a time.
thats a very good question.
"why am i here?the thought of life, living things, and why everything is here is complicated at times."
physics in general is a fascinating topic and answers many questions about us and our planet and i feel like most of our questions can be answered because of physics.
i was able to stay for the semester and take the physics lecture and lab.
hopefully this time i'll be able to take in the topics more better than i did in high school.
"so far, i am having fun with this class."
life just comes and goes.
this is important because in science how i get an answer is just as important as the actual answer itself.
without their help i would not be at san francisco state university or in my physics 112 class.
i was a teen mom so i spent some years at community college.
i hope that this supplemental class will introduce me to new people to maybe from a study group with.
quite honestly this class saved me in my other classes too because i took multiple sci classes before and not only for organic chemistry.
i never really knew what i wanted to study until my sophomore year of high school when i took biotechnology.
elon understood it was possible to reduce the cost of making rockets.
"i would like to think that i am here, because i have some purpose in life."
i need to work it out on my own on paper or try to then have it be shown to me on how to correctly go about solving the problem.
austin noriega 9102020 phys 102 reflection 1: why am i here?
one small step at the time.
i'm here because i worked very hard in my first two years of college in order to change my major to something i liked more than what it was before.
"it is not an easy roadmap, with many different chemistry and biology course that i have yet to enroll in."
to me this is a huge blessing and a huge opportunity that unfortunately many people dont have.
"this is important because i believe god is the truth, the way, and the life."
it has been a minute for me that i havent had any physics classes.
"it here to learn new things, meet new people, and to be able to learn the culture and how is the america dream that a lot of people from the different country dream of."
i try and make small connections and interactions as personal as i can in hopes of creating a bond that can create joy in my life.
i have programmed a raspberry pi and arduino but most of the actual building of the robots and circuits was through kits with directions and i didn't feel like i really understood the wiring of the robotics so i knowledge of circuits might give me better intuition of building things that aren't pre built projects with directions.
"my hopes for this class is that i can internalized the important topics covered in lecture and reinforced in this sci class, and be able to relayapply this information to my future prospects."
i started undeclared and for my first 4 semesters basically just did ge classes.
i am attending science 111 to better understand the physics concept.
the instructor is friendly which is a pro.
the last time i took chemistry was about 2 years ago back in my community college and i was struggling with the subject.
i also just wanted to attend a 4 year college right away and san francisco state was one of my options higher on my list
ive always been enamored by the stars as a kid.
maybe i might change my major if like physics a lot.
"i have found physics interesting before, but it is not my favorite subject."
i hope to use this skill for my current classes and see how this impacts my ability to learn and understand.
i am here because this class is required for my major.
things have not come easy for me for several reasons but i have continued to persevere and will continue until i get my m.e degree.
i feel like physics is a good combination of math and science versus other science classes ive taken before.
ever since i was little if have always been fascinated with aircraft and me at first wanted to be a pilot.
"after all, their program is intense, and they want to make sure that i am able to keep up with their curriculum."
i am in physics because it is required by my major.
but when i moved to sf i met so many people who genuinely loved what they were majoring in and who couldn't wait to be in their classes each day.
i also will have to retain this information as i also need to take physics 2.
the implications of the amount of work and dedication that vet school required didnt fully hit me until i was in high school.
i am preparing myself to work through a lot of issues and hardships i might face doing all of this learning.
i am here because this room is my sanctuary.
but i do have an interest in physics.
"i am currently a biol physio major, which means i have to take gened bio whether i like it or not."
i also wish to learn more about physics and to work with teammates to finish the lab experiments.
because i love to understand how things work.
we can't always dictate our life and find the answers but it helps me to find purpose by doing mindful actions such as being present today.
"why am i currently sitting in this chair in this classroom on this campus, and how did i come to be here?"
"before, education was only for the elite, for the people who could afford it."
i dont want to be known as that person who is something in particular.
"i am a christian, so i believe our existence has purpose."
"i had apply to many schools but san francisco state is the only one that accepts me and also because it is close to my home , so i choose to be here."
i feel like it helps me review and get a better grasp on what i need to know in order to pass the class.
"that is why i am here.sfsu was actually one of the schools that i got into for undergrad and was considering for my bachelor's, however usf ended up being a cheaper option after scholarships."
"it allowed me to practice the science concepts and topics that were covered in lecture class, prepare and review for biology exams, as well as giving me another resource when i am confused about something and need help."
"when it shifts to the right, when it shifts to the left."
whydid i choose physics instead of some other course this semester?
i am here because i don't know what else id do.
i love to travel and visit new places i have not been to before.
"which means i am gaining knowledge that is not only taught by the professor, but also from my fellow peers."
taking physics so far has taught me the importance of all the mechanics used in real world appliances.
i figured if there was a time for moving out it would be best after high school.
from a young age i always had a passion for health and fitness and this has evolved into a passion for health and medicine later on in my life.
this in a way freaked me out because i had no expectations on how the course would go but i was worried i would not find success in the course.
the reason why i am here is to seek help with bio 240 because biology it is not my strong suit in subject wise.
i also like to learn physics because it is more handson than any other science in my opinion.
"i also think physics is important because it helps build on skills such as creative thinking, problemsolving, and lab skills."
"therefore, i took this class not only for graduate, but i also hope that i can learn something from this class that i can apply to my senior project."
i think i am here because i am passionate about connecting with people.
i dont know why we are obligated to submit these kinds of reflective essays when everyone is not taking these seriously.
i need this class for support because lecture can get very confusing however if both sci class and lecture are misleading then i might need to seek outside help.
amanda friedman why am i here?
i also want to graduate early and take as many classes as i can to be able to reach my goal.
this class serves me in multiple ways which helps me learn without having to go to tutors all the time.
