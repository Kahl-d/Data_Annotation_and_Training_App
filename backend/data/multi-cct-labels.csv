i here to show those family members that they can be here too.,Filial Piety
"my family is very bug on education, so everyone generally aspires to go to college.",Filial Piety
the second reason why i am here at sfsu is because of my parents.,Filial Piety
"but why i ended up here at sfsu is because my parents didn't want me moving up to socal, and my only choices were school's up here.",Filial Piety
"i am intrigued by this career because i grew up with family who died due to heart conditions, therefore i want to be able to understand and form conclusions on my own that way i can comprehend the cause of their deaths.",Filial Piety
i am here because in my family it is expected of my brothers and i to go to college after we graduate from high school.,Filial Piety
"my mom has a masters degree and my dad has a bachelors degree, so it was never a question of if we go to college.",Filial Piety
i am here because well also to provide for my family one day to be able to do the things they weren't able to do when they were younger.,Filial Piety
i made a choice to go to college because i see how difficult my parents and grandparents work without a college education.,Filial Piety
that everything i do with my life will not only help my family but everyone in my community.,"Community, Filial Piety, Social, Spiritual"
in todays society most individuals want to support themselves and their family as well as live as comfortably as they can.,Filial Piety
"this is why i am motivated to keep going to school and work hard because im the only whom has this opportunity thread a path of a better education, thus is one of my goals to inspire future family generations and help them out and continue the cycle and break it.","Filial Piety, First Gen"

"towards the end of high school i found out that through hard work in my studies, i would be able to reach my goals and even provide the next generation of my family the opportunity to enhance their living standards as well.",Filial Piety
so when thinking of why i am truly here i guess it is to help give myself opportunities for my future and the future of a family i will have someday.,"Filial Piety, Social"
i have a expectation to do better than my sister since my parents consider her not the best per say.,Filial Piety
"after a year of attending sfsu, i remain here because of the need to provide my parents with the feeling of accomplishment of having me graduated from a 4 year university.",Filial Piety
"another reason is to why i'm here is because im the first of my family to go to college, hence i'm trying to make them proud of what i'm trying to accomplish.","Filial Piety, First Gen"
"my motivation includes money, family and specifically my mother.",Filial Piety
"for money, i just think to myself im not gonna miss any class because i am paying damn near 3500 dollars for this.' for my family, i always think ' i am going to make enough money to support them.' lastly for my mother, i think 'i am going to make her proud.' considering all of these reasons.",Filial Piety
"the reason i am here is because i want to make my mom proud, to support my family and because i am not paying 3500 to miss any classes.",Filial Piety
"coming from an immigrant family, being apart from my parents for many years, without having the support and motivation to keep my dreams going was nothing short of easy.",Filial Piety
i want to be able to help my family out with paying bills and stuff.,Filial Piety
i chose sfsu because i wanted to be close to my family and not have to commune all the way across the city.,Filial Piety
a future in which i can be financially stable and support my family.,Filial Piety
being able to support my family another advantage of being financially stable.,Filial Piety
neither of my parents ever got to 7th grade so they have always pushed my siblings and i when it came to school.,Filial Piety
i am not only doing this for myself but also for my parents.,Filial Piety
"im here for myself, my goals, my grade, my family and primarily for a better understanding.",Filial Piety
i am also here so that my family sacrifices to put me through school aren't in vain.,Filial Piety
despite what my grades may say.im here because my family wanted me to have a better life than they did back in china they gave up what amazing or bad opportunities they had all for my and my brothers futures.,Filial Piety
im here because my parents didnt bring me here for for me not to take advantages of all the opportunities that i have here.,Filial Piety
i am a very family orientated person so i just want to make everyone happy and proud of me .,Filial Piety
im here because of all the sacrifices that both my parents have made for me and my little sisters.,Filial Piety
im here to disapprove stereotypes im here for a better future for myself im here for my family and everything they have given up for me to be here.,Filial Piety
i am here because my parents want me to finish college.,Filial Piety
i believe that i am here to help others since i have always grown up taking care of my grandparents and siblings.,"Filial Piety, Spiritual"
"for example, i knew the roles i would have to take on when my little sister came into the world; i needed and wanted to be a good role model for her so she can come to me with whatever problems she is going through.",Filial Piety
"yes, i am here, getting a degree because that's what my family and society expects of me and i know it's something i have to do, but there is so much more life than a career and academics.",Filial Piety
"in terms of why i'm at college, it's because it's difficult to start a decent career without at least one degree and i want to be able to provide for myself and my future family as adequately as i'm able.",Filial Piety
"i'm passionate about the field and i want to use the opportunity to help those that are less fortunate and at the same time, help support my family.","Filial Piety, Spiritual"
if i had to guess why i'm here it would be because my mom needed me to be here.,Filial Piety
"they want a gift or a blessing or just help and i think for my family and specifically, my mom that is me.",Filial Piety
"and now, as my mom gets older i look after my sister who really needs me maybe i'm just here to look out for her the whole time.",Filial Piety
another benefit of completing this goal is making my family proud and inviting them to do anything they want because i will have enough money.,Filial Piety
"i want to be able to make my parents, family, and friends happy because of what i can do and show them that i can do it.",Filial Piety

deep down i am doing this also for my mother and my family to have a better education that my family was unable to get.,Filial Piety
i also want to be a role model for my 4 siblings and show them that college is an option and it can lead to many opportunities.,Filial Piety
"before i was listening to my parents who told me that a science degree would not give me the amount of job opportunities later on in life, but now i have learned that if your whole heart is not in something, then it is not worth doing.",Filial Piety
but looking at how i got here is something truly amazing as all the accidents and coincidences have led me to this moment.,Filial Piety
"why are you here?the reason why i am at sfsu is because i wanted to be the first in my family to go to college because my mom really wanted to see one of her children going to college and i was the last out of her 3 kids that has the chance to go because my older brothers didnt want to go to college, and i wanted to make her proud.","Filial Piety, First Gen"
i am here to do what she didn't and prove to my family and friends i can go through a higher education.,Filial Piety

i wanted to help figure things out because i felt that it was important to ensure that no one comes across these illnesses that have killed many of my family members.,First Gen
overall i am also here because i am the only one in my family to have ever gone to college.,First Gen

meet people who have (similar) aspirationsgoals network be helpful to experience explore improve,Social
to learn more about the natural world and build relationships with many diverse people who are as passionate as i am,Social
i am excited to be here in si because i get to give my students and peers what my si facilitators have given to me: a safe place.,"Community, Social"
i am here because i care about my community and to help empower those around me.,"Community, Social, Spiritual"
i am here in this class specifically because it's been almost six years since i've been in a physics class and i know i am going to need all the help i can get.,Social
its also comforting that people are in the same boat as me in needing additional help.,Social
"to be completely honest, i prefer just sitting down in groups and try to work on the problems together rather than moving around from table to table.",Social
this whole time i wanna meet new people too because i dont wanna be alone in getting help.,Social
also we are all helpful too like i feel comfortable the person next to me that im dumb and i dont get whats going on at all and be okay to someone that.,Social
i feel like it is much easier to find a solution to a problem if lots of minds are put together.,Social
"sci provides the opportunity to interact with a diverse group of students who all come from different backgrounds, who all bring different perspectives and ideas.",Social
i am here because im not afraid to ask for help and guidance.,Social
i was apart of a sci course last semester and i loved how helpful the instructors were.,Social
sci allows a welcoming atmosphere where i can be helped by the instructors or my peers and we as a unit are able to solve problems.,Social
"it definitely makes life a little easier, having classmates to talk to ant work with, or reach out for help outside of class.",Social
"weve been bros for a few years now, and we all work together and just mess around all the time.",Social
"if im not worried about my classes, then i can be even more supportive to my girlfriend.",Social
"by taking the time to make sure that i dont fall behind in my classes, i can really make sure i can devote more time to helping her with whatever she needs.",Social
"i know it is called a supplemental course to help us do better in a certain class, but i like how it is open to everyone even if you get 100 on every exam or quiz or whatever it is that you do in that class.","Social, Spiritual"
i also want to meet new people so we can all study together and help each other.,Social
"name 3 and name 4 are also pretty cool, they're very open and will help in any way they can.",Social
"maybe this class will also help in my life in general, to do work harder and work with a group better.",Social
it does not hurt to get extra help and honestly it is an easy a that is one unit.,Social
"at first, i thought that i was not going to get the help that i needed, but the last class we had changed my opinion because it ended up being really helpful.",Social
this is why i decided to sign up for sci 111 and receive the extra help i knew was necessary in order for me to pass this class.,Social
"i have already made a group to study with, we all have different teachers and can help each other figure out things one teacher might have focused on more than another.",Social
(and if not i will just come back to sci and get some extra help),Social
the reason of this is because i began to slack off towards the end of the semester because i was barely coasting by the course with a decent grade and as the course became harder and the longer i did not reach out for help.,Social
i would like to get to know more people in the class so that we can form a study group and not only study but complete homework together as well.,Social
in this case i am referring to not being afraid of asking for help when i desperately need it.,Social
this class gives us more practice problems to help prepare us for exams and this is why i enjoy being there.,Social
"i also am here because i know that i am not the only one who is struggling, and seeking help.",Social
"i believe that this class will help me accomplish that task, and help me be more prepared for what is to come in the future.",Social
its been a great experience to see that even helping one student with their work could be very rewarding and i might think of becoming a sci professor in the future as well.,"Community, Social"
"my main reason to take sci like many other students, is so i could receive help for physics to do better in class.",Social
i'm here to solve practice problems as well as work in groups to help myself as well as the participants in my group.,Social
he explained that the sci class has a small community where students help and stimulate each other and work together.,Social
i also like being helped by other students whove taken the class already because i feel like sci instructors can explain things better than some professors.,Social
"when i heard the option to enroll in a supplemental course for physics, i knew i had to enroll for the extra help.",Social
"not only would i have more practice with physics problems, but i would be able to connect more with my fellow classmates.",Social
"i figured that if i felt like i created a little community with the supplemental course, i would feel more comfortable with physics problems.",Social
with a community i would feel comfortable enough to ask questions without having to worry about sounding unintelligent.,Social
"these sci classes will help me accomplish that through, making myself accountable to go to class each week and get extra help.",Social
"it is very helpful to have someone in the same shoes as you, since you are taking the class together it is a much better time to get to know your class mates and forum study groups.",Social
so far from the first three weeks four weeks of class i have gotten as on all my quizzes given in my main classes thanks to my sci helper classes.,Social
we were together for seven years since we were thirteen years old.,"Community, Social"
"he was my rock, my best friend, and my biggest supporter.","Community, Social"
"ive been making new friends in my new classes, and creating new study groups in my science classes which has really been a large help for me so far this semester.","Community, Social"
i also have my study group since my freshman year so we help each other on anything so that's why i am able to take 18 units because of the help i have around.,Social
sci is better than tutors because sci helps more your gpa than tutors.,Social
sci classes also help you make connections with people that might be in the same class or major.,Social
so far this class has helped me be able to communicate with others and teach others what i know and listen to what they know.,Social
"i have tried making a couple study groups, but it has not been able to help me yet.",Social
"the class is small but that allows to get close, know each other, and help those that need it.",Social
we were both worried that physics would be harder than we expected and we both encouraged each other to take the sci class for our respective physics class as a way to help ourselves.,Social
"i love helping people, so that is why i wanted to become a physical therapist.","Social, Spiritual"
"if i had classmates that didnt really care about the assignment at hand and did something else the entire time, then it would be very difficult for me to work as hard as i do on the various experiments with other people.",Social
"we make and analyze some datas together, which is a joy in the class, and can build up my oral communication ability.",Social
i also have talked to one of the advisors for premedicine students and he provided a thorough list of courses i needed to take ignorer to satisfy the prerequisites for medical school.,Social
many students have gone to him and are either in medical school or applying to medical school.,Social
i really am proud on the decision i made because moving to a new city really helped me evolved as a person.,Social
it brings certainty in the mind of the students about the basic concept of the subject.,Social
i am here for myself and for everyone that has supported me throughout my journey at san francisco state.,Social
i like doing labs because i get to collaborate with others and work on lab assignments.,Social
this will help me meet other people that are in the same major or similar.,Social
i'm also in this class because i enjoy physics and believe this class will help me with my major.,Social
being able to work through tough problems with fellow classmates teaches me how to work hard and do it alongside my peers.,Social
these are valuable skills that will definitely help me later on in life and going through a rigorous class will only help foster these skills even more.,Social
"this lab involves group work, which is very helpful skills to have.",Social
gaining perspective and insight from my professors on how they organize their class and how they interact with students has and will prove to be valuable in contributing to my future.,Social
this class can help me getting used to collaborate with other people and build up the skill.,Social
"i did not know what life was here, what is the environment is like, and the community we going to live with.",Social
our professor makes this class really enjoyable and hes really helpful.,Social
my groupmates can help me fill the gaps that i can't remember.,Social
"i like to work on the labs together with my lab partners, it makes things a little bit easier.",Social
i really felt a community from my peers as well as you guys as my instructors.,Social
"im here because, initially, i was worried about my ability to be successful in my ochem course without the help of my peers.",Social
im here because i need help to pass ochem. i would like help from my science community because its hard to get help and noticed when we are so many students.,"Social, Spiritual"
i feel that being in a community of scientists or likeminded individual will push me to pursuing more.,Social
so knowing im not alone and having support is great.,Social
i also feel that it will be a great place to meet people and form study groups since were going through the same classes.,Social
"if you're asking me why am i on this earth, and why am i alive, i would answer to make memories, and to meet people that positively impact me.","Social, Spiritual"
"i think the students deserve someone who genuinely cares, and wants to shape the future.","Social, Spiritual"
there is really nothing comparable to the feeling of just bonding with someone and feeling as though your two personalities are perfect together.,Social
i have friends now that ive known since the 7th grade because we all value the strong bond that we have created together.,Social
"the lab i enjoy as well because we have the breakout groups and they let me work with other students, makes me almost feel like i am in class again.",Social
"i have found that being in this stem community is very beneficial to me, in making friends and meeting new people who will help me grow as a student and as a person.",Social
we were really able to collaborate with our classmates to help each other along and i really enjoyed the field trips.,Social
i know of a friend who got into a lab after graduating so i hope i can follow their example if i try hard enough.,Social
another thing that comes to mind on why i am here is because i get to help others which i am always glad to do and reassure them of their insecurities.,"Social, Spiritual"
"talking with an advisor in the department would help, which im grateful that the scheduling is finally available now.",Social
"since i was younger, i had always wanted to help other individuals.","Social, Spiritual"
"i love hiking, soccer, rugby, and i am a premed which will help me get to know more people and know people who are similar around me.",Social
"though i'm not going to lie, ive been a little embarrassed to seek help in the past i know without extra help i most likely will not pass this class.","Social, Spiritual"
"i'll also try my best to be more willing to participate and raise my hand more to help move the lesson along, but i will say i am kind of shy, so please be patient with me.","Social, Spiritual"
this class also have people helping each other and i am proud to be part of it.,Social
"with the help of this class, people will not struggle as much as they do in their regular math class and it will definitely save some grief.",Social
this class also helps us prepare upcoming math exam and also go over homework problems that we have trouble so we can earn the most point possible.,Social
"when andrew came to my class to offer this class to everyone, i thought that this would be the perfect opportunity for me to get the extra help that i knew that i am going to need.",Social
"also, its nice to have classmates that are also in a similar position to me and also want to do good in math class because they help inspire me to keep going and trying harder.",Social
i am here in this support class for calculus 2 because i feel like i am struggling a little bit and i feel like i can do better if i just have more practice and more help from people who know how to do it.,Social
i also want to make new connections with students and maybe form study groups with them so we can work collaboratively to aide each other as we are on the same college journey together.,Social
im also here to meet new people in my major and build some bonds and studies groups so we can excel together.,Social
i am also here to get away from my family ad community and figure out what i want to do in life and also figure out who i really am.,Social
"i really enjoy this sci and i know that it will help to pass calculus 3 this semester so i dont have to repeat it next semester, i believe that everyone should a sci class because they truly do help.",Social
i also want to make new friends who will be taking higher math classes like calc 2 3 so that we can help each other then.,"Social, Spiritual"
this can also make new opportunity to meet people who have the same major as me.,"Social, Spiritual"
"i also have an interest of one day teaching this class, because i think its important to help my community.","Social, Spiritual"
it bothered me at first but it was also nice to see that most of my friends from community college ended up coming here as well.,Social
having that small transfer group actually helped me a lot in my classes this past semester because were all engineering majors.,Social
as a firstgeneration college student it has been really hard to figure this out and try and find ways to help me in my classes these sci classes has really helped me reach out and find people who have the same goals as me and to have a study group of my own and be able to ask questions outside of class.,Social
"i also wanted to join the class, because unlike chem 180 with 100 students, this class is pretty coo just being about 10 people entirely.",Social
especially when we were preparing for the first exam they gave me the cheat sheet and helped me with questions.,Social
when my t.a. told us about a tutoring class where i can receive a unit for showing up and getting help.,Social
i am hoping that this class will also take some stress off of the studying aspect of chem 180 and will allow me to study better by having perfect opportunities to discuss the material with the instructors and with my classmates.,Social
i think because the facilitators are students who took the class prior really helps because they can help us in improving our study skills.,Social
i feel that working in groups help you find what mistakes you are doing when studying for a test or solving a specific physics problem.,Social
we are all here to help each other pass the lecture class of physics 121.,Social
when i was preparing for the first exam i was able to ask my sci instructors for help and the material that was given to us really helped me understand the general concept.,Social
i know the reason why everyone is in the class because they have similar reasons like i do; being able to connect with one another and build more information together.,Social
"i realized the more people you know the extra help you can get with the sections i am struggling with, because someone is bound to know that topic by the heart or know a different way to explain.",Social
getting different opinions and ideas is always helpful to me.,Social
"so, with the help of my sci professors and classmates i hope i am able to pass this class.",Social
i truly want an a and the only way i can do that is being on top of work and getting help from people or anyway possible.,Social
"it's great that i'm not the only person in that class that needs help, i do have my friends in that class.",Social
"we can help each after sci class, sometimes we don't get to sit with one another during in class but that's okay.",Social
we can help each other on topics that we are not strong in.,Social
sometimes in such a big classroom it is hard to ask questions to your professor which was another reason why i signed up for this class because i get one on one help from my peers and also the sci facilitators.,Social
it also easier to ask questions and get help so i don't fall behind in class and get motivated to study more.,Social
so i am here taking this class mostly because i need help.,Social
i just like the help from everyone.,Social
"first of all, i am in this class to get as much help as i can with chemistry.",Social
"with this class, i not only hope to get as much help as i can but also to meet people in order to make a study group and make connections for the future.",Social
the most helpful part of the course is when we sit in groups and the team work really helps due to peer mentoring.,Social
i am here in a sci course because i have an awareness of my chemistry and math abilities and i know that i could use the extra help.,Social
i also think that this sci class is a good way to meet more people and i always look to my peers for extra support.,Social
its also fun getting to collaborate with the other students in the class.,Social
i also like how sci class allows you to meet other students that you can turn to for help and form study groups with.,Social
"plus, i was able to meet other peers who are looking to major in biology and since some of us relate with each other, i can ask for advice on which classes to take for the next semester in order to keep me on the right track.",Social
"i am here because i need a good grade for the course and i believe that this sci course, just like last semesters, will definitely allow me to acquire nothing below a b. i am also here because it allows me to associate much more with my fellow colleagues and help each other out to take down any type of problems and questions that we need help on.",Social
like it is said the students kind of lead the conversation into the class and i like that people actually converse with each other and engage in the topic.,Social
it also helps me to create study groups at other times.,Social
"i have to take ochem i in order to take biochemistry, which i need for my major and i heard about this class when brent came in to invite students to add the course.",Social
in the past i found that i would always study by myself but it helped when i would study with others.,Social
it is great to hear about how other students do their problem solving as well as how they study so that way i could think about picking up study habits from them.,Social
i hope this course will help me to clear any confusion that i have had during lecture and work it out with my peers.,Social
i stuggle making friends or gathering the courage to make plans with classmates to study together outside of class.,Social
"it helps to trap others in a small confined space, thus minimizing their possible escape options, and forcing them to talk to me.",Social
im also taking this sci class to help with my time management on studying.,Social
i also will feel less intimidated because the people teaching the class and more my peers than they are my instructor.,Social
this is also a way for me to meet people in this course that i could gain some help with as well as help them (to the best of my ability).,Social
also to possibly see if there others in my other courses that maybe we could help each other in those courses as well.,Social
we are here to be inspired by the loads of information that make us who we are.,Social
also this class allows me to sit with students and just ask questions about related topics aswell like from my 451 class.,Social
"since some people are taking the same parent class as i am, i am able to connect with these people and we are able to benefit each other by discussing our lecture and creating study groups to prepare ourselves for tests or to help each other with homework.",Social
so far it's been helpful sitting in a table with other classmates discussing and solving problems that are challenging at some point.,Social
"details are important specially refreshing some math from previous classes that are covered during this class, not such good examples using matlab but at least they provide a general idea.",Social
"also, in this class, i could to make some classmates that i never seen before and able to get their help as a group work assignment to do some of the problems on the worksheet that had given in this course.",Social
this sci class can help me to more practice problems on the topic that might talk about it during the class times and it would might show out the topic for the help on the subject better.,Social
i also find it very helpful to have my peers explain certain concepts rather than my professor on certain topics.,Social
i feel very lucky to have access to this help from my peers and i look forward to challenging myself academically this semester.,Social

if taking this course means that i will get closer to my goals than i will happily take this course.,Class 0
"in conclusion, i would say i am here for a quality education and to meet new people from different backgrounds.",Class 0
the question why am i here? is a very broad question.,Class 0
i am thankful for all of the opportunities we have to look forward to together in california.,Class 0
schooling is important because after we are done we will be released into the world with the ideas we have been forced to learn and with all that information we have to make money.,Class 0
"i am in college to learn as much as i can because i think the more i learn, the more capable i am of thinking well, of being useful, and the more beautiful and amazing i think the world around me is.",Class 0

"this semester,i hope i can learn more experimental abilities and develop good habits of doing experiments in phys 232.",Class 0
also something i didn't ever think id do.,Class 0
i enjoy learning about how our world works because it allows me to come up with ideas as to how we can make it better.,Class 0
i have heard that physics is a hard subject and takes a lot of concentration and time to fully comprehend the world of physics.,Class 0
"this past semester i changed my major from business with a concentration in accounting to biology (with a concentration in physiology.) during high school, i wanted to go to university and study biology as a premed.",Class 0

but why am i here?,Class 0
"in order to do it, i found my path that i have to love myself first.",Class 0
"i probably wouldnt be taking it if i didnt have to, but i definitely do.",Class 0
i transferred from sjsu this semester after i switched from being a premed student to a computer science major.,Class 0
i am wondering what is there to physics other than forces?,Class 0
i am in sci230 because i needed it to reach full time student status.,Class 0
however i have now realized that they truly help especially since the class itself is a really fun environment within itself and the work we do is learning with one another and not simply copping notes that the professor has written down on the board.,Class 0
this class will also help build the foundation for my knowledge for computer science.,Class 0
i have had better understanding with biology as a whole.,Class 0
i love basketball do not get me wrong.,Class 0
it also helps with problem solving skills and critical thinkingtwo very important skills to have as a software engineer.,Class 0

"its harder for me to completely process all the information in physics, only because the processes and concepts are less familiar to me than the concepts in chemistry and biology.",Class 0
but there were als things i learned that were discussed later on the week.,Class 0
"for me personally, i feel that this course is not extremely importantrelated to my major and everyday life.",Class 0
just your average orange county douchebag and it turns out that he was a data scientist for instagram.,Class 0
i am here because it is one course closer for me to get my degree.,Class 0
my goal here are to help myself develop better study skills so i can be less stress and have more time to actually enjoy my time and research im doing on campus.,Class 0
i also like the idea of being able to teach as a way of memorizing the material that i've learned.,Class 0
i assume it will not be hard because it is the lab for the introductory physics course.,Class 0

i am taking physics 112 because it is one of the required concentration courses for my major.,Class 0
"i want to do more than exist, i want to be happy and i want to have purpose.",Class 0
i find it really hard to retain information during the lecture because its so much information to receive in such a short amount of time.,Class 0
i think that the concepts behind how motion works is very fascintating.,Class 0
i have previously taken a sci 115 course and it heavily contributed to bettering my study habits.,Class 0
i sure hope being in college can be the right direction for me instead of being a waste of time and money to where i worked so dearly hard to be at.,Class 0
often times i struggle with taking tests so i am hopeful that this semester will take a positive turn from visualizing my work.,Class 0
i struggle in day to day life and classes because of the grief.,Class 0
for each one i always end up saying so that i dont miss class and can graduate.,Class 0
the third reason why i am here is my dream to go to new york.,Class 0
"also, it helps me to recognize how much i really understand or not.",Class 0
"it was really a no brainer for me from the start, and i knew that i would be taking this class over a biology lab.",Class 0
"despite the fact that i need this class for my major (biology), i am at college because i hope to learn both inside and outside of the classroom as well as ideally apply what i learn in school to the real world.",Class 0
i am taking this class because i havent passed calculus 1 is one of the reasons and i took physics in high school but it was a long time ago soi need this class in order to refresh my memory about topics that i have forgotten.,Class 0
not only for these reasons.,Class 0
"i am here for many reasons: make myself proud happy getting education is a priveledge, knowledge is power!",Class 0
at times i feel like these classes are not relevant but have come to learn to have an open mindset because you never know if you'll find another internet and passion that otherwise you would have missed out on.,Class 0
i signed up for this class in hopes that i would get a bit more practice and help figuring out the problems that i couldn't figure out last semester.,Class 0
"id want to teach kids how to program, code, and how to think because technology is going to be everywhere.",Class 0
i am here in lab class to get a better understanding of my physics lecture classes.,Class 0
i lack the motivation that i once had because college is stressful.,Class 0
i heard many things about physics and the most thing i heard was that it is very hard and complex.,Class 0
"although this class is truly a general ed required for me to graduate, i chose it because i love this subject.",Class 0
i have already used the knowledge of my peers in this sci class to solve a problem i was not familiar with.,Class 0
"(i dont yet know which)i am also looking into pa, which i just became aware of through other classes ive taken the summer.",Class 0
could even end up just maxing out in units for the next two years.,Class 0
we help and teach each other the material and thats what i like about it.,Class 0
i am here because you can never have too much help.,Class 0
"i one took a physics class back in mexico and i actually like it, because it basically explains every movement but with numbers, making it an exact replication rather than just words or imagination.",Class 0
"my major is biochemistry, and this is a requirement for my class.",Class 0
"i joined this class with the purpose of it helping me in furthering my knowledge of chem since my main chem 180 class is just to short off a lecture, just being 50 min.",Class 0
i dont regret joining sci 115 because it has helped me a lot and it has helped me learn new learning techniques that i wouldnt learn on my own and has helped me to learn new ways to study and to learn and how to do chemistry over all.,Class 0
i believe that i am here because im a biochemistry major and this class is one of my requirements and i believe that this class will help me and give me the tools and a different perspective of things as i go on further into my studies in the chemical aspect.,Class 0
"this class can teach you how to work with others, which i think is a critical skill to learn.",Class 0
"why am i here?i am here because i have to fulfill a major requirement, and i also want to get the knowledge needed to go further into my major.",Class 0
before signing up for this class i never thought that sci classes were a big help.,Class 0
it is my 5th year here and hopefully by the end of 2021 i will have completed all my required classes for civil engineering.,Class 0
no one has the same purpose in life.,Class 0
and so it just happens to be the case that i am here that's my answer to the why.,Class 0
it is a discipline that studies the laws of nature.,Class 0
"this included online banking, bill pay, mobile deposit, and more.",Class 0
"right now i feel it was a good decision, helped me understand new topics and more problems to practice with.",Class 0
i chose to come up here because i've always wanted to come to the bay area since in my opinion is a beautiful city.,Class 0
i am here in this physics lab so i can fulfill a requirement for my major in biology and move one step closer to getting a degree in biology.,Class 0
"by being in that class, i'm surrounded by my peers i can learn and reiterate the material in my brain.",Class 0
i know that physics 102 is suppose to make your understanding of physics 101 a lot clearer and easier to learn.,Class 0
when deciding on what school to transfer too i remembered how much i love the atmosphere of sfsu and of the city.,Class 0
"i made the mistake of not taking a sci class when i was in calculus, and my grades suffered from it.",Class 0
"i chose to major in computer science because i love computers and also, im interested in technology.",Class 0
"after working minimum wage part time jobs while in community college, i've learned that there is no way i can do that for the rest of my life.",Class 0
"i am also excited to start using math to learn physics, because it is a subject that i have begun to understand and appreciate much more.",Class 0
i was originally a general biology major.,Class 0
we learn everyday even without the intention to do so.,Class 0
"to better understand what compounds these molecules can make, i decided to take sci. since the class is taught by students who took organic chemistry, they know what the professors are looking for and how to approach certain questions.",Class 0
"i dont know exactly, i dont think i am here for any specific reason that i know of.",Class 0
i can possibly minor or double major in economics if i feel like taking a few extra courses but have not decided.,Class 0
i love everything that is related to math and can be calculated.,Class 0
i don't think i'd take this class if it wasn't.,Class 0
i will probably have to memorize a lot of formulas and make sure i dont slip up on my math.,Class 0
"well, to start off, i found this question pretty vague, which i'm assuming is the point of this question.",Class 0
the reason why i want to go into the stem field is because engineering intrigues me.,Class 0
with other people's work you see what that made in which science denies.,Class 0
i would like to get an a in o chem 2 because i struggled with o chem 1.,Class 0
"before i came to the us, my liberal arts scores was alway floating on the pass line, but my science scores like chemistry and physics scores are always over 140 out of 150.",Class 0
"it took me a year after high school to get here, and i wasn't going to do anything else.",Class 0
"if i am not mistaken, all science class have a lab that comes with the lecture which is why i am taking this course, and it will be like this in the future for more science classes i will be taking.",Class 0
i do believe there are worlds among us and perhaps other life in space.,Class 0
"learning physics is helpful to not only me but to all because it answers the basic fundamental question of how this world works, or of its appearances and natural disasters, etc.",Class 0
"im hoping this time around, it will work out for me.",Class 0
also i just really want to invent something that will benefit society one day but in reality i just want to design and recreate something out of scratch and build it better.,Class 0
"i tend to learn better when the class sizes are smaller and more interactive compared to the stuffed lecture classes so by working in groups, we can learn from each other.",Class 0
"i would love to work in a lab and be able to look at samples (tissues, blood, urine, etc.) in the microscope and tell whether someone has cancer, aids, etc.",Class 0
i have never taken physics before mostly because i am intimidated by the math in it.,Class 0
"in getting a good grade and being here regularly, this increases my chances of doing well and being successful in the real world by developing good work ethic and study habits.",Class 0
the reason why i am here is because ive heard chemistry is hard and it intimidates me.,Class 0
"however, speaking in more broad terms why am i here at this school, san francisco state, well that is because i am trying to earn a degree in biology, and hopefully have a wellpaying job in the future, as to why most people go to college.",Class 0
karla martinez why i am here?,Class 0
"specifically for this class, this is a prerequisite for my major, and it is a mandatory class to take with phys 0220. however, for the following 3 semesters, i will be trying to pursue music while taking ge courses for my major.",Class 0
i am glad i chose to attend school here.,Class 0
also i know that being any type of engineer is required to understand majority of physics and know how to do calculations in order for myself to become an engineering field specialist.,Class 0
another reason why i am here is to aim for the best grade i deserve while still understanding the topic instead of copying off someone else or online.,Class 0
"i hope that through the sci course, i bring my grade in the parent class up to an a. with a strong foundation in physics, i can also hope to be a better physician in the future as i will have a more developed understanding of motion and how the body moves.",Class 0
"i tried to take phys111 last sem, but i couldnt keep up with professor xu and had to drop out.",Class 0
"i think it was the second day of physics 111 class of this semester, facilitator 1 came to our class and explained about sci 111 class, in which i had a good impression of the class.",Class 0
"finally, i believe that the process of getting a degree is really an exercise in gaining knowledge that can be applied in the future to change my beliefs.",Class 0
i self motivate and try my best to encourage others to learn and understand the importance of concepts so they in turn will do the same.,Class 0
its interesting that there are so many things i do in everyday life that relates to physics and i never realized these little things until now.,Class 0

it was just ok.,Class 0
"so for me, that would allow me to be part of the workforce and be able to find a job in this area.",Class 0
"this class, will help me strive and understand concepts that my professor has taught me during the week.",Class 0
i also think that having a bit of knowledge in chem or physics its more interesting than what everyone else is doing just math.,Class 0
i expect my professors in both lab and lecture and able to be prepared before the actual class and i also expect them to grade everyone with the equality and fairness.,Class 0
"going off of that, when i do well in certain courses, i find more interest in that subject and want to continue doing well in that area.",Class 0
"it's been a while since i've taken calc, but i am going to try my best.",Class 0

i have taken some other classes in my previous years of education and i surely can say this one is the most interesting one.,Class 0
"information such as gravity, pressure, and volume from learning physics and their laws help with understanding the body.",Class 0
i will have the opportunity to have the extra practice with physics problems without the stress of having to worry about my grade.,Class 0
taking this class allows me to see the equations that we see in class to solve problems put into real world uses and allows me to further understand the equations and reasons that these equations exist.,Class 0
"currently im interested in mobile app development, but if that interest ever changes then ill have a lot of skills still applicable to other types of work within the stem field (at least, other types of programming work).",Class 0

there are whole other worlds out there and i feel so small just on this one.,Class 0
it deffenitly keeps my brain working by asking myself and thinking for the real true reason why one must be in any class.,Class 0
i want to make a decent living and without school id have to do that though something like labor working.,Class 0
this sounds like a knock on the class but it's more about what i would get from this class and if i would use it in the future vs taking a class on something like machine learning and using that in the future.,Class 0
"i am here to absorb new material, make mistakes, and learn from those mistakes.",Class 0
"it is a little hard to see how physics is related to cell biology, but when trying to relate it to molecular biology the connection becomes a little clearer.",Class 0

"all in all, i am here because physics is a requirement for me, but it doesnt change the fact that this is fun class to take.",Class 0
why am i at san francisco state university?,Class 0
i like having a lot of options because i do not like having to chose between two things as it tends to be unfair.,Class 0
"as for the second reason, i could have not come to class today, but i am here because this class is only once a week and it's quite interesting.",Class 0
"i was born in the city, grew up ion the city, and now living my early adulthood in the city.",Class 0
"im a 5th year here at sfsu, majoring in kinesiology and minoring in anthropology!",Class 0
i am here to soak up as much one on one interaction as possible in the department of physics.,Class 0
i enjoy going to the gym which is why im a kinesiology major.,Class 0
i also needed the extra unit that this class provides so it was a win win scenario for me.,Class 0
i am in this city because i go to this school (a little obvious haha).,Class 0
"i constantly question my purpose, but also am reminded of my purpose.",Class 0
i learn best when i am in a class setting working with other students and peers.,Class 0
i didn't really study with anyone for the first exam but i think i'll be able to for the second exam.,Class 0

it has been my dream ever since i was eight years old.,Class 0
i am trying to major in electrical engineering.,Class 0
why am i attending san francisco state university?,Class 0
this will help people come up and generate new ideas when working on a certain task.,Class 0
zoom and other similar platforms are able to bring people together from all over the world.,Class 0
i am here because part of reaching that dream is not only to follow steps without learning from them.,Class 0
"so far i'm definitely trying my best and i'm doing okay in schoolwork life, home life not so much but things happen, i'll get through it.",Class 0
"i believe i am here to spark change, be a spark of something that should have been present long ago.",Class 0
"but i really dont know what to do after college, what i should major in, and what job i would want.",Class 0
this is why i am here and i look forward to meeting all these goals and it has been a blessing to be where i am now.,Class 0
i personally think everyone should take physics to learn more about how things work and why they work like that.,Class 0
"because honestly, i wouldn't be here if it wasn't for them.",Class 0
i believe i am definitely here for a reason.,Class 0
but i'm hoping that this class will change my mind about how i feel about physics and so far i am enjoying this class.,Class 0
i chose to come to san francisco state university because my friend attended school here and recommended me to try it.,Class 0
i am here because i am going to learn about physics and why it exists.,Class 0

"there will be many obstacles, especially during this time with all the stu going in the world today but with grit and growth mindsets, we all can persevere and get through it.",Class 0
"so many of these courses were humanities and just consisted of reading and writing, read this book and write this essay etc.",Class 0
this makes me worried about passing the class with good grade.,Class 0
i guess i want my life to be exciting and fun.,Class 0
but currently right now i found another purpose of my years here.,Class 0
"aside from that, i am also here to further my education not just to get my degree but to also help me better my understand of the world.",Class 0
"i would also love working as a park ranger and protect our national parks which sometimes get disturbed by us humans by leaving trash, not being cautious with fires and more.",Class 0
i am here because i am.,Class 0
the reason i chose to go into the stem field is because i have always liked learning.,Class 0
to be completely honest if i had a choice i would have probably not been taking the class only because of physics in one of those subjects that i would not mind not taking.,Class 0
i have enjoyed this university thus far because i feel as if every teacher is doing their best to help us pass.,Class 0
"as a freshman, i contemplated whether or not i should choose a concentration.",Class 0
i never took this class in high or middle school.,Class 0
"at 28 years old, i have came across several roadblocks that has directed me to quick.",Class 0

this is why i am here at the university and why i am here in this class.,Class 0
i am in college to further my education.,Class 0
"for this course, i expect to be able to relate the theory that i learn in 230 and be able to understand it in practical terms.",Class 0
i am here in this particularly coarse because it is a prerequisite for other classes and necessary to obtain my degree.,Class 0
this is the case with science for me.,Class 0
so this is why i am here at sfsu majoring in civil engineer.,Class 0
i wish to improve my math skills and conversion skills.,Class 0
but again after a year of that i realized i wanted to do even more.,Class 0
i always excelled in the life sciences and their connection to the real world always seemed to grasp my attention.,Class 0

i picked up photography from my dad when i was little and have been taking photos ever sinceits my way of journaling and i find it very therapeutic.,Class 0
"solving problems and just all about calculating numbers, but after taking my first semester of physics, i realized that physics is a combination of science and math.",Class 0
i also decided to attend classes at sf state because i was born and raised here and i went to high school right next to state at lowell high school and wanted to stay somewhere in the city or near the city to save money and also stay close to my family.,Class 0
"when going to even broader terms why am i here on earth, well one could say it was simply because my parents got together and from there i was born?",Class 0
and it certainly beats taking any kinda of lower or upper division ge in terms of interesting material.,Class 0
"what i'm planning to learn in this class is how things move and to be able to apply it to the real world, a.k.a., driving a car or a plane flying.",Class 0
"i do want to succeed, but i am not afraid to fail either as long as i can find one thing of any size to show i learned something and what to do for the next time.",Class 0

my knowledge on the subject of physics other than the basics is kind of abysmal and my knowledge when it comes to electricity and magnetism is pretty bad.,Class 0
so far i've been having a great semester for the first time in a long time i finally dont feel like im behind in all my classes.,Class 0
i'm often asked by my friends why i have to calculus and physics courses.,Class 0
the question 'why am i here?' is a little more complex than it is.,Class 0
united states has been my dream to go because of the land of opportunity.,Class 0
i am here in this classroom because i must receive a grade that will determine whether or not i will be proceeding to the next class.,Class 0
i dont necessarily care for physics but it is interesting to learn about and especially being able to understand it but i can also live without knowing too much about it.,Class 0
i just really want to make a big impact and leave my mark.,Class 0
"for example, there is a lot of physics involved in ocean currents and how water is moved around the world.",Class 0
i feel like the weekly quizzes were ineffective because my seminar section was before my lecture so the material on the quiz especially during the end of the semester hadn't been properly covered.,Class 0
im fascinated by moviestv shows.,Class 0
i intend of understanding more of this course that really puzzles me.,Class 0
i mainly need to focus on the formulas that are used and my problem solving skills.,Class 0
"i always knew i was to go to college, but i wasnt sure for what.",Class 0
i took it in highschool and i think that makes it easier for me to conceptualise the concepts.,Class 0
"now im thinking that i am here because i just want to learn more about the subject and how i can apply this to real life, as well as my major.",Class 0
there are things that i learned in chemistry that i have seen in physics.,Class 0
"it is apart of my identity, and it allows me to connect with a piece the piece of humanity i thought i had once lost.",Class 0
this is not really the case for any of my other classes.,Class 0

"if we can reduce how much we use, then how much waste we produce is also cut down.",Class 0
"in all reasons, i am sure that many things happen for a reason, at divine alignment (when you let things flow in the universe).given that physics 112 is a undergraduate prerequisite to my intended m.d. program of study, i am required to be in this course.",Class 0
i hope to continue my long but heartfelt journey so that i can have a career and a life that i am proud of.,Class 0
"still, i had a very annoying experience in high school with physics.",Class 0
i am here in sci305 because i did not understand many concepts from 305 when i took it.,Class 0
i am already seeing similarities from physics 111 and 112.,Class 0
i am in physics 112 becasue it is a corequisite for physics 111.,Class 0
"honestly, if it wasn't required i probably wouldn't be in this class.",Class 0
"someone is going to pay well to create something, and it is pretty fun to be able to come up with an idea to a problem that someone has and be able to take that idea and create something tangible from it.",Class 0
"personally, i decided to search for a stem related major, because i feel like it will align with my interests and hobbies, and lead to me finding a job that i can be happy and proud about.",Class 0
i am here because this class is a requirement for my major (civil engineering).,Class 0
"in the fall of 2017 when i first began my studies here, i was only taking electives and calculus i as a math class.",Class 0
ive taken physics 2a equivalent to physics 111 in city college and the professor explained most of the concepts clearly.,Class 0
as something i tend to study materials that is not even in the exam.,Class 0
i have so much to study for physics 111 even though the school semester just started.,Class 0
now that's something scientists are still uncovering everyday and i think it's really neat to be able to see these discoveries which raise even further questions at times.,Class 0
i went to college so i get an education about the things that i will need for my future careers inside of the business field.,Class 0
however i did need a lab and a physical science for me ge's and i instantly thought of physics when i learned that.,Class 0
"if everyone came together, learned about each other and have an open mind, the world would be in a better place.i, myself can't do much as a person at the moment, but my goal in life is to be in a position, where i can make a change and be an example to others.",Class 0
i think this stems from me not really grasping the idea of physics.,Class 0
i have been around my home for almost two decades and i wanted to reinvent myself.,Class 0
"for me, the biology sci 230 class was very effective because it actually helped me understand and think more in depth about the content i learned.",Class 0

"even though some classes can be very difficult, they make learning fun and interesting.",Class 0
"also, i love science, and since physics is a science course, i wanted to take it.",Class 0
i am here because chemistry is a really challenging subject and i need all the extra help i can get.,Class 0
i am better at learning subjects that are around real world problems and where you can work hands on and actually see what you are dealing with.,Class 0
i'm not sure if this response answers the question but to be real i have been trying to answer that question within me for a while now and all i can say is that i still searching for that answer.....but i'm not sur if i'll ever truly find it.,Class 0
"going into this course i feel uncertain about how well i will do, since the last time i took this class was in high school.",Class 0

i am here because even though its one of my prerequisites for my major degree i would like to learn more about physics and enjoy the subject.,Class 0
i look forward to this semester.,Class 0
physics to me is the study of how things move and how things interact with each other such as gravity and forces.,Class 0
"before starting my freshman year two years ago, i was applying to schools for architecture and for computer science.",Class 0
i could be at bed right now or taking a hike or going to the gym or even better walking my dog at fort funston.,Class 0
i am confident that sci 321 will give me the needed practice and help me excel in chem 321.,Class 0
"instead, i see change come with technology.",Class 0
i decided to come to sf state because my sister went here about 8 years ago and she told me what a great school it is.,Class 0
"turns out that, that class also did not count for my lower division ges so here i am taking astronomy lab.",Class 0
i am presently in thornton hall room 116.,Class 0
i feel hopeful in my tiny place.,Class 0
now i struggle with o chem 2 because i don't knowremember anything from o chem 1.,Class 0
i like that i have time to review topics i did not understand in class and ask not only the tutors but peers as well.,Class 0
i came to sf state because it was closer to home and it was going to save me a lot of money.,Class 0
"for example, cell phones work based on the principle of electricity and the electromagnetic spectrum.",Class 0
ever since i came to san francisco state i constantly ask myself this question.,Class 0
the reason for taking sci is that i may be able to understand the concepts of physics and the subject itself to the best of my abilities.,Class 0
i am here at san francisco state university to prepare myself for the future.,Class 0
my prior experience during my high school was never boring.,Class 0
it is my first day here because i have been temporarily assigned to this class.,Class 0
"i cannot afford to fall behind, especially in my biology classes so i have to take all the precautions necessary to keep that from ever happening.",Class 0
"i suppose there is no real or ""good"" reason for why i am here.",Class 0
i ended up just giving up on passing the class.,Class 0
"and going to college is optional for those kind of job, as the employers values coding experience and projects over a degree.",Class 0
its interesting to know how other planets are different than earth.,Class 0
"originally, i wanted to go into the stem field because i grew up in a workshop working with my hands so i thought i wanted to learn the physics and science behind it all.",Class 0
however it wasnt until high school i learned that i would to make a living off science.,Class 0
physics helps me get out of the memorization zone and get into a more logical zone.,Class 0
"it is for sure going to help with my critical thinking and problem solving, whether it is for math or solving a real life problem.",Class 0
"computer science has brought me to this course, while i am generally pretty unfamiliar with how physics works in our daily lives, i am at least curious to see it calculated and derived throughout actions i do daily.i hope to be able to take away material from this course as i would any other cs course, regardless of my selected major.",Class 0
i am here because i have always wanted to see what physics was about.,Class 0
i haven't taken a physics class since high school but i do remember some things like the types of energy and transfer of them.,Class 0
"directly i am here, writing this response in physics lab, because this is a course required for my degree and i am receiving credit for writing this.",Class 0
but everything has changed when my grandpa passed away in my senior year.,Class 0
this sci course will hopefully make me feel comfortable in future science course and perhaps i will gain studying or academic skills i will use in the following years.,Class 0
i do enjoy learning more about science in general.,Class 0
"why am i here?in the sense where we are talking about why am i here, right now in the lab room, i am here because i am taking a course further complete my major and hopefully graduate on time.",Class 0
in terms of physics i never took this kind of class until i was in college.,Class 0
"initially, i did not want to go here.",Class 0
"but i also like the vibe of this city, its much different as opposed to the other cities nearby.",Class 0
"it is high time to reconsider how to make questions because ai is developing, and it will replace our jobs with automation.",Class 0
"when i am around my peers in that classroom, i sense a connection and i know that they want what i want, which is to understand physics and pass the class with a good grade.",Class 0
i believe that biology is one of the major subjects someone needs to understand if you work in the medical field.,Class 0
im just letting life flow and wherever it takes me is where ill be.,Class 0
i believe that by attending san francisco state university i have decided to attend here.,Class 0
there isnt much to say other than the fact that i wish life were kind of different and i am sure that many others feel the same way.,Class 0
the subject is useful to many car makers and pretty much everything in our lives.,Class 0
you need to get a degree to get where you want to go.,Class 0
"to me, this is my first step into becoming financially independent, since having a degree helps with getting a good job, although in my field, it would mostly be freelancing opportunities.",Class 0
"i am currently at sf state, in the beautiful city of san francisco.",Class 0
i want to take full advantage of this course and try hard in order to really understand the material and pass my actual calc class.,Class 0
"in previous courses in this subject, i have not necessarily struggled but have had to work hard to do well.",Class 0
i was nervous for the lab at first because i had no idea what kind of labs we would do or what they would consist of.,Class 0
"i am required to take physics with calculus 1, along with its lab portion concurrently.",Class 0
i am someone who is very curious and has always asked questions.,Class 0
i am here because i wanted to take on an astronomy minor since i love learning about the planets and stars of our universe.,Class 0
i am here because i always wanted to be involved in the stem field ever since i have been a little kid.,Class 0
also every time ive went to get the lab manual it was difficult they are always closed.,Class 0
this is the reason why i am here so that i can acheive my goals and what i am passionate about.,Class 0
the homework we are assigned has problems that are tough for me.,Class 0
"like its what i am here to do, why i'm here, if you will.",Class 0
this lab course is a concurrent enrollment course to the phy112 course.,Class 0
kind of like living life to the fullest and having no regrets.,Class 0
"i heard and seen that the science department is really good, sfsu is known for their science classes so i thought it would be good for me to start my career.",Class 0
one of the main reasons i am here is to get an education.,Class 0
why sf i ask myself that question a lot but it is a very vibrant diverse city.,Class 0
i thought everything was lost.,Class 0
i hope i am able to repeat the lab or a lab similar because it was the one i enjoyed the most.,Class 0
"learning something new, as i will in this course, is a step in the right direction.",Class 0
"this isn't to sayi wasn't interested in engineering, but there was a lack of confidence in my academic abilities.",Class 0
i also am interested in how eveything works through classical mechanics and think it is entertaining to toy around with the concepts.,Class 0
"im not bad per say, but im just worse at it than i am with other classes.",Class 0
"now that i am in this course, i am happy to attend a class that helps me understand the concepts of psychics.",Class 0
shes someone who highly supports me getting a college education and she is one of the reasons i continue to push myself even when things get difficult.,Class 0
"is also to understand the dimensions of time, and space.",Class 0
"i really love this book which is why i chose it, i hope you read it.",Class 0
but i am here because this is the life the world believes is the path to a life without struggle and without hardship.,Class 0
"physics gives us powerful tools to help us to express our creativity, to see the world in new ways and then to change it.",Class 0
"one day, a friend approached me about joining a construction trade.",Class 0
"the teachers here are very nice and caring, so learning from them is a privilege.",Class 0
"the main reason on why i or other student want ot go into stem fields are that the science, technology, engineering and mathematics all the fields are much important in every type of career and its perceived in every part of our life, having knowledge in these area is helpful for every student in pursuing jobs thus it motivate them and me to develop more passion for it to be more success in these areas.",Class 0
i used to actually brush off the idea of doing anything related to physics because i always thought of it as a confusing concept about how things move or happen.,Class 0
or because we enjoy this?,Class 0
on top of that i'm an ra as well so that's always stressful.,Class 0
"that way i think that the future is riding on me, so id better do my best.",Class 0
i am honestly excited to get started and learn new things in this lab.,Class 0
"iroronically, it is a arbritary number.",Class 0
to be honest i am really just taking this class to graduate and its been a couple of years at least since i took my astronomy class so remembering all of that info has been alittle hard.,Class 0
"the school is a good size, and has a lot of amazing buildings.",Class 0
my regiment pushes south at dawn.,Class 0
that is not to say that i am disinterested in physics.,Class 0
"i like learning, studying, thinking, doing , and participating to job work.",Class 0
physics is one of the hardest sciences courses i will be taking and should be fun.,Class 0
i just find it to be an interesting subject that we could apply everywhere else.,Class 0
why am i here?my journey into physics started with my interest in computers.,Class 0
"whether it be good or bad, the influence it gave me, made me a better person today.",Class 0
"finally, after the last semester sci 220, i found it to be super fun.",Class 0
"i'm a biology major, and learning about other sciences such as physics and chemistry are really beneficial.",Class 0
this gives me the understanding that ill need should i decide to pursue further physics knowledge and give me the concepts that ill need to know for my major.,Class 0
i can only hope to be half the people they were.,Class 0
i am here in this class to learn more about physics in a physical way rather than in pure equations and numbers.,Class 0
i believe i am in san francisco for many reasons.,Class 0
i am taking this class because i am also in physics lecture and intriguing and it seemed interesting.,Class 0
"i believe in my case because i want to work with sharks, physics will play a large part when it comes to the sharks ability to sense living things due to their electroreceptors.",Class 0
i am from sacramento and i am here on the bay because of my focus and motivations and refusal of disruptions and deterring of my focus.,Class 0
"like i dont know there a lot of different reasons why i am here, some that i know about and probably some i dont know about.",Class 0
the application to real life may help me understand how certain things turn out to be.,Class 0
there is a lot physics involved with waves and how they form.,Class 0
if i hadnt taken one specic class in high school by chance then i would not be pursuing the career i am right now.,Class 0
"i wouldnt say im the most inclined towards physics, but i understand its usefulness in learning the concepts it encompasses.",Class 0
"i expect this supplementary course to give me a chance to build on what i have learned in the lectures from chemistry 321, and i hope it gives me the opportunity to ask questions about things im not sure about from the chemistry 321 lectures.",Class 0
i enjoy the challenge for solve problems that people have trouble with.,Class 0
but this class will help me learn about the introduction of electricity and magnetism.,Class 0
"i also just generally enjoy science, though it can be difficult at times.",Class 0
having to take this class expands our horizons to how the world works today.,Class 0
this will only benefit me in the end because i will be able to apply physics outside of class.,Class 0
i am here in this lab class because this physics course is a requirement for my major biology.,Class 0
the reason why i am taking general physics i lab is because it is one of the requirements for my major.,Class 0
it is pretty confusing and does not come easy to me.,Class 0
"well, there are a few reasons, i guess.",Class 0
i am here to help others in life whether thatd be through my job or outside of it.,Class 0
"with enough studying, i can most likely make it through physics without struggling too much.",Class 0
i enjoy being able to see the direct correlation between what i was taught and how it affects the world that i live in.,Class 0
"i am very happy to be here, you seem so sweet and smart.",Class 0
"here at sfsu we get to focus a lot more on the stars, planets, go more in depth about earth, the sun, the moon and its phases.",Class 0
"i also haven't learned any physics since 8th grade and didn't have a great teacher then, and since science is my favorite subject to study and math coming in second, i look forward to learning more about the branch of science that i know the least about.",Class 0
"i was cared to ""start over"" in a sense, but i know i would regret it for the rest of my life if i didn't take the chance and try.",Class 0
why am i here?i am here because i dont know anything about physics instead of taking physics with calculus 1.,Class 0
the reason i am here at this class because i really wanted the unit to get a minimum of 12 units for my cal grant then my first time coming to this class felt really helpful.,Class 0
"why am i in this field, in the field of engineering, specifically computer engineering.",Class 0
"all in all, these reasons are my main motivating factors for pursuing a stem related major or career.",Class 0
"all very different from one another, then i thought what career would allow me to work with animals, travel and be outside.",Class 0
"so i am here for my own individual pursuits, and to shape the lives and pursuits of those around me.",Class 0
but that's why i went into stem.,Class 0
there are many factors holding me here and keeping me from leaving but definitely to environment has kept me steady and focused on my goal.,Class 0
i feel like i am also here to teach others my own beliefs and what i think of current issues.,Class 0
the reason for why i am at san francisco state university is to reach my goal of working in a wildlife rehabilitation or conservation center.,Class 0
also i needed to take this class if i was gonna take the regular astronomy.,Class 0
it is the least i could do for all the things they have given and taught me throughout my life,Class 0
you do not know what will be in front of you or if it will be easy or hard.,Class 0
i have to blame my mom.,Class 0
this will keep pushing me to strive to be better.,Class 0
"here i am now, trying to remember why am i here.",Class 0
"however, i feel like as long as i can do it correctly.",Class 0
"as a human physiology student, i know physics is essential to better understand the mechanism of how the human body works.",Class 0
we cant just wait and hope that someone someday will solve those mysteries for us.,Class 0
"the specifics of physics hold very little importance in my mind, even if the entire body runs on it i dont need to know how the electric fields of the heart interact because that is only peripherally what i am studying.",Class 0
"i am here because i am in my second year of college, now meeting the math requirements in order to take this class.",Class 0
i have a dream that is to learn things in computer science and then program a game myself.,Class 0
i hope that this class will continue to help prepare me for more moments like those.,Class 0
"because this is a physics class, and it is related to some common sense in my life, and it has some connection with mathematics.",Class 0
i believe attending this si course will develop and improve my overall understanding with material i may be struggling in.,Class 0
"my goal is to graduate with a degree b.ab.s. however graduating with an understanding in scientific field, get involved in biology, reach for new resources, meeting new friends, study in the library, nights of a studying and homework is all worth going to sfsu.",Class 0
the question came up again in my head entering college.,Class 0
i like to go on nasas page every now and then to see if they have discovered anything new.,Class 0
"instead, she pushed me to join the robotics team.",Class 0
"jackie hernandezseptember 2 2020 why am i here in life, i believe that each of us has a meaningful purpose.",Class 0
"sometimes, i honestly feel stupid, but i know how to get out of that feeling, and that my friends is why i am here in sci305.",Class 0
"firstly, i needed to be able to flourish by myself away from home as a young adult.",Class 0
i think it will be important the things i do now to help with future sceneries.,Class 0
i am here because not only it is require for my major but to understand more about physics on a university level that i will fully experience for the first time.,Class 0
good communication can also allow group members to understand their roles and perform better work.,Class 0
i do not necessarily care about the grade i get as long as i pass.,Class 0
i know that is class will bring me one step closer to that goal.,Class 0
i am here because i want a good grade in the class.,Class 0
especially since the lecture is fastpaced and i would need a midweek review with all the material so i can understand the next day of lectures.,Class 0
and that is why i am here.,Class 0
i have set my goals and priorities straight; i prefer to stay home and study rather than to go out because i know in the long run all the studying is going to pay off.,Class 0
i love my job but my body is starting to disagree.,Class 0
"so as all over the place this whole write up was i believe i am here on this planet to live my life long dream of being part of the fashion industry, while making a positive impact environmentally.",Class 0
"i needed, and i stress needed, to learn how to manage my time, personal time, and find my motivation to get through these school days and finish this degree.",Class 0
college is a privilege and a choice and i choose to educate myself so that i can get a big career in the future.,Class 0
"i do not know what it is though, but it is a nice thought.",Class 0
"i just know that since i am here, i need to make the most out of my time.",Class 0
"i know it won't be an easy road, nothing ever is, but i am willing to put my blood and sweat into it.",Class 0
the instructors can help me achieve my goals of passing bio 230 by motivating me and assisting me with my biology work.,Class 0
when you guys had came and explained the class i wish i had taken it sooner.,Class 0
"personally, i have trouble making time and sitting down to study alone.",Class 0
"i didnt want to accept the importance behind why physics plays a hefty role in chemical functions, but after spending time looking over the class concepts and materials i am less intimidated by these courses.",Class 0
"to prove to myself that i am capable of more than is expected of me as a latina, woman of color.",Class 0
i chose to take this course because it goes along with my physics lecture this semester and it meets my prerequisite requirement for my major.,Class 0
in highschool physics was very challenging for me but i loved t the entire year because of how interesting it can get.,Class 0
i feel like this opens opportunities to be friends with someone who is on the same path as you and this is an easy way to get to know others around you and to be able to surround yourself with others who are just like you.,Class 0
being in this class is important because not only are we reiterating what we learn in phys 101 it helps us grasp the ideas better and easier if we hear them in lecture and demonstrate them in this class as well.,Class 0
"while it is required of me to take this class, i very much do look forward to learning about the type of physics we cant see much of and learning how this is applicable to everyday life.",Class 0
i am in this class because i need physics for my major which is cell and molecular biology.,Class 0
"i was originally unable to make it to come to this section, as i am taking chem 233 that would have overlapped with this class.",Class 0
one of the main reasons that i am going into the stem field is due to my dad's company.,Class 0
i am here because i needed to complete this course as part of the biology graduation checklist.,Class 0
"besides that, i think physic can be such fun.",Class 0
"first, i took ap physics in high school, so i thought i had a good grasp of things that would go on in class.",Class 0
i am here in this class to travel my path to that point in my life.,Class 0
i am majoring in civil engineering and knowing physics is a significant part of the engineering field.,Class 0
i am a biology major and thus need to take phys 111 and phys 112.,Class 0
"i enjoy learning about physics, dont get me wrong, but it takes me a while to get the hang of things.",Class 0
i believe everything i have been through and accomplished has led me to this exact place in my life.,Class 0
"also, as a kid i have always loved to build and fix stuff and i knew i would be happy if i was able to continue doing this as a profession.",Class 0
"i also took my friend with me, devin because we're in same physics class so i won't be alone.",Class 0
however i am glad to be here in the city of san francisco because i believe there are many exciting things to do here.,Class 0
this pandemic didn't need to happen if our politicians weren't so concerned about themselves and their wealth.,Class 0
physics can provide me with a basic understanding in how things work and move.,Class 0
i always wanted to experience a new environment and go from socal to norcal.,Class 0
you don't think its cool at all?,Class 0
"this course will help me develop critical thinking skills, and give me a different perspective on life.",Class 0
"i enjoy stem topics such as mathematics and biology, and i am beginning to become more fond of physics.",Class 0
physics is also a part of everyday life so learning it can improve the normal life itself.,Class 0
i hope it works out.,Class 0
i think i will enjoy this semester a lot more due to the fact that theres more of an appeal to me.,Class 0
my goal is to get closer to them and learn about them.,Class 0
it is a great feeling and i hope there are more sci courses offered here for my upper division classes.,Class 0
i took many classes while there but did not finish the lower division physics requirements.,Class 0
aside from taking this class for gradutation requirements i also hope to learn some concepts that are discussed in this course.,Class 0
there are many things that i don't understand and have questions for.,Class 0
"the reason i included the phrase, ""role model"" is because people who come from my socialeconomic background generally do not end up working in stem. at first i thought i was because most of us don't have an interest in stem, but overtime i've started to believe it's actually because most of us don't get exposed to stem. the way i got exposed to stem is kind of an interesting story.",Class 0
"i will say that after having done a few of the physics labs already, some of the lecture material is beginning to make sense.",Class 0
i am also here to build experience in the work force as well as building experience for my resume.,Class 0
"i also am a very hands oninteractive learner and i dont really get that in the lecture but in this class, i think that i will be able to better understand the material better because of that.",Class 0
"if we develop another thinking ability, we can survive.",Class 0
i am here at san francisco state university to receive an education and to major in mechanical engineering.,Class 0
"im excited for what the future holds, but also nervous because things dont always go as planned.",Class 0
"a lot of scientific subjects are based on physics, because the laws in physics can be applied to almost any scenario.",Class 0
why am i in this supplementary instruction class?,Class 0
why am i going to college?,Class 0
i recognize that before i started this lab that there was going to be some math involved but i wanted to try something i would have not choose as my first option.,Class 0
i've taken physics twice in high school: regular physics in my junior year and ap physics my senior year.,Class 0
"i don't believe that that is the entire reason i'm in the class, however.",Class 0
"why i'm here then begs the question, who am i?",Class 0
"well, i didn't necessarily want to go into stem. actually, i chose to become a computer science major because i want to go into game design, though i'm not sure if i even want to do that anymore.",Class 0
so far the first lab we did was something i enjoyed but also was a bit difficult because the way the lab was worded was a bit confusing to me.,Class 0
i do believe physics can play a role in the physical therapy field which is what i am trying to go into.,Class 0
"i also learned a lot more things throughout the course, such as what the big dipper is, where polaris is, and even how to observe the stars at night and use a compass to see which direction im in and what the altitude is.",Class 0
i have never taken sci classes because i was lazy or thought i didn't need it.,Class 0
i also hope to continue learning about something i learned in the pass more in depth .,Class 0
i don't normally get the chance to go into depth with or look into certain things that i may learn from this class.,Class 0
"furthermore, this physics lab course will allow me to learn how to use a variety of instruments.",Class 0
"of course, to get to that point, i had to go to college.",Class 0
"depth issue, having some background knowledge of other engineering disciplines will make it easier us to understand each other",Class 0
i used to be an emt. i loved that job so much.,Class 0
they sacrificed everything in their life to make sure i went to college and i am grateful for that.,Class 0
i have learned that many of the different courses actually are related with each other despite being about different concepts.,Class 0
i wish i was a lot ahead by this age but i won't let that bother me too much.,Class 0
i am taking physics 230 because it is a prerequisite for my major.,Class 0
"all i know was, this country will give me a better life than my own country.",Class 0
i have always had a fascination for biology because it teaches you how things around you and in your body work together to create what we call life.,Class 0
to understand the concept of physics will help to be more knowledgeable in my surroundings.,Class 0
but what was i really going to do with all that saved time?,Class 0
"kinda cheesy, but its the truth.thats why im here.",Class 0
it is crazy to think that everyday life and actions can be calculated with physics or have to do with physics.,Class 0
"i feel that i am taking this class because of that but also because it is very valuable to learn to be prepared for the mcat. i hope that through this lab class, i will be able to learn more indepth and truly understand the fundamental concepts in the course.",Class 0
i took physics back in high school and if i would've gotten a better score on the ap exam then perhaps i would've been taking the second part of physics.,Class 0
"however, i need to make it through a long hard path of schooling to chase this dream.",Class 0
"and this course is meant to help my major, or i think it should help.",Class 0
this way i would be able to relate the lab to the lecture and the lecture material to the lab.,Class 0
"to answer why i am in a physics course, it is simply because it is a prerequisite for my engineering courses.",Class 0
"physics will teach me interesting and useful knowledge like motion and behavior through space and time , and the related entities of energy and force.",Class 0
"although i don't like physics so much before, but i try to learn as much as i can from this short class.",Class 0
i suppose im taking this sci course so that i can expand my general biology knowledge to see if i can apply biology concepts in my future research work.,Class 0
"though i may not have a set purpose everyday, what strives me to keep going is the unknown future; it can always be a better day tomorrow.",Class 0
i am taking both a physics111 sci course and chemistry115 sci course.,Class 0
"today, i am here to discuss about vectors in 1 dimension and 2 dimensions.",Class 0
"i don't like waking up early, but that is a sacrifice i am willing to make in order to have the rest of my day to myself.",Class 0
a large amount of co2 is made by burning fossil fuels.,Class 0
joining this class will help me prepare for future lectures i will have in chemistry 115.,Class 0
im taking a sci classso i hope that class will give me a better foundation.,Class 0
my purpose is to get the most out of life.,Class 0
"science in general has always been easier for me than history, english, or even math.",Class 0
"i have taken sci courses for my other science and math classes, and i have learned a lot from my sci instructors regarding class material.",Class 0
"i think this class will help me with recognizing the physical laws at play in real time, in all aspects of life.",Class 0
journal 1: why am i here?,Class 0
computer science can also be used ingame design so technically it is part of my original plan.,Class 0
"i am majoring in environmental science, i choose this major because of my love for nature and this planet that we live on.",Class 0
"asking the essay prompt why i am here? to myself, i wonder what here means?",Class 0
i was not sure if i wanted to take a sci class but i have never taken a physics class in my life so i knew that this class was supposed to help me out.,Class 0
so there are some things that i am familiar with.,Class 0
"also, it is the last physics series i would need to complete and move on forward for additional classes until it is time to graduate from this university.",Class 0
i am here at this university to help me further my education and to be able to have bachelors degree to hold a successful job.,Class 0
"however, one of the most important reasons that led me to want to go into stem is that i feel that there is a need for more latinos to be part of stem. i believe that if we can get enough people from every background to be part of stem, we might reach some kind of stability for everyone in all these important jobs.",Class 0
"after taking a microbiology course when i was a nursing major, i fell in love with it and thought it was fun.",Class 0
thank you.im back.,Class 0
"while the distance learning is good and it keeps everyone safe, it has it's complications if some students don't have the proper equipment, and opening schools back up for kids is a very bad idea since kids could spread the virus to others.",Class 0
"everything to the why it is the way it is to what will it become in the future? before i can even begin to know myself, i think its important to know the biology of a human being,to know how we have changed throughout the years, how some civilizations have mysteriously been completely wiped out.",Class 0
this class is meant to lay a foundation for the basics of physics and give some background for the future.,Class 0
"through this class, i hope i can figure out how im understanding the concept through other peoples perspectives and help.",Class 0
"another reason why i am here is, i like to procrastinate with studying.",Class 0
"specifically speaking, i'm in this class because it's listed as a class that kinesiology major students have to take.",Class 0
"i was put through emotional turmoil in the beginning stages of my life, bringing me to develop who i am as a person.",Class 0
i am here because of something greater putting me here to accomplish something that i may not even know about yet.,Class 0
for my physics is very difficult to first comprehend which discourages me a lot.,Class 0
i am very open to learning new things that i have never seen or was taught before.,Class 0

i also want to always expand my mind and keep all my options open.,Class 0
"physics is something that applies to all of us in day to day life, thus being in this class, it would be interesting to see which rules of physics are being applied in what we do.",Class 0
i am taking this sci course because i tend to need extra help with my chemistry courses.,Class 0
"as a biology major, even though physics is different from biology, i think learning about all the fields in science is helpful in understanding the world.",Class 0
my friends and i decided to join science 115 to learn for deep about the lectures we learned in chemistry 115 class.,Class 0
taking this physics course will hopefully instill me with valuable knowledge i can use to be successful in a work environment.,Class 0
"when we call our family with the cell phone, our voice is converted into an electrical signal.",Class 0
"im interested in learning about physics for the first time, as well.",Class 0
well am i not be smart enough but i work hard enough to be here.,Class 0
"i still get really hard on myself each time i slip up, but i hope i can be more of a best friend to myself in some way.",Class 0
"i could probably take on physics without take a supplementary class, but taking physics along with chemistry, calculus, and biology during the same semester is rather risky.",Class 0
"we get to do more hand on activities which is how i kind of learn better, or it's proven for people to learn better this way.",Class 0
"having a graphic designer major, the two would think not to go well together, but i believe that they do go hand in hand with each other.",Class 0
biology and chemistry courses have been great because they come naturally to me.,Class 0
so there are a few different ways it seems we couldve gone with this question but ill go with the why am i here in context to this school.,Class 0
my main goal out of this class is to understand the material well and succeed in this class.,Class 0
i am here because i was getting home sick and i did not want to be far away from home.,Class 0
"he made his dreams come true, but it did not really last long.",Class 0
"the homework can be a little difficult, mostly because a lot of the material on it can be things that we haven't covered yet.",Class 0
"throughout my life, i've always wondered what the meaning of life is and what's our purpose as human beings.",Class 0
in high school the physics labs were very superficial and i hope that this lab covers the concepts in more depth and has more labs that can thoroughly describe concepts.,Class 0
"unfortunately, i joined the sci class as we were beginning to go over unit three, so i am hoping there will be someone i can ask for assistance with the other units.",Class 0
did you know that the only stem field to see a decrease in women in the last 30 years was computer science?,Class 0
it is so intriguing to learn about something greater than myself.,Class 0
so yeah that's why i am here.,Class 0
it should be rather an elective course for those who plan to or are interested in computer science fields that deal with that such as biotech or other fields that need this knowledge to build and code the information necessary to make the instruments work for them.,Class 0
this is my first ever semester taking a chemistry class ever.,Class 0
i tried my best to take the most general of general education classes while i was still deciding my major.,Class 0
"this isnt an issue for me, but it does feel punishing to be here in a sense.",Class 0
growing up i would go to yosemite a lot and we would always star gaze.,Class 0
im willing to work hard for this grade and do whatever is necessary to do well.,Class 0
i believe i am here because i am trying to learn what i need to know in order to get into the career i want.,Class 0
hopefully ill learn something useful that i can use later in the future or present.,Class 0
i have been having trouble with getting use to this new online platform because i am use to in class sessions.,Class 0
i wonder why i'm here all the time.,Class 0
"if i had done precalculus in high school, which was an option for me, i would have been able to take this physics class sooner.",Class 0
"now with the understanding of where physics falls on my plan to physical therapy, my views have improved.",Class 0
i want to save lifes.,Class 0
i am here not to become a failure nor end up like many that called inquits after their freshmen year.,Class 0
i am here in this class for various reasons.,Class 0
but i just haven't reached the conclusion of that question for myself.,Class 0
i have attended the physics lab class this semester.,Class 0
what happens when a ball falls down?,Class 0
"moreover, getting into a great physical therapy program will eventually lead to fulfilling a goal of mine.",Class 0
"i know that sometimes we go in groups for labs and i am pretty comfortable with doing group lab projects.the other reason i took this class is because i know it will benefit me in the future with other classes such as math, chemistry, biology, and much more.",Class 0
it is not my time to die yet.,Class 0
our question was which college we are planning to go too.,Class 0
i was never very good at math and i knew that physics requires a lot of math problems.,Class 0
we are here to love one another and to make discoveries regarding the world.,Class 0
the instructors took us out at night took look at all the constilations and i loved it.,Class 0
last semester i took chemistry 115 and sci 115 concurrently and it helped me understand more about the parent class.,Class 0
the reason why i am in this class is because it is required for my major.,Class 0
"physics is a requirement, but aside from being a prereq....",Class 0
"after that, i wanted to become a paleontologist, teacher, then an astronomer.",Class 0
optometric has so many physics calculation to determine patient eye number so what i need is to improve my skill from physics base to achieve my goal.,Class 0
i was wrong when he made his video lectures he made them overly explained.,Class 0
"i took general physics 1 last summer semester as a head start, so now im taking general physics two now.",Class 0
i am also here to further my education so i can work in the medical industry.,Class 0
college is completely up to you so i don't go into my classes with the mindset of why are we even learning this.,Class 0
i have also been fasting for the month of ramadan the last month so that has been keeping me occupied.,Class 0
i'm here to move through my degree requirments.,Class 0
the only classes that i would take would be chem classes.,Class 0
"we never left the bay, and i had lived my entire childhood in the cities san francisco and daly city.",Class 0
"in addition to that, i am here in the class because i need this class to fulfill my ge requirement for graduating with biology physiology major.",Class 0
the excitement of science keeps me engaged and it satisfies my curiosity in a way that plain mathematics does not.,Class 0
but then i found out about this sci class and the first day i learned more than what he had taught.,Class 0
very enthusiastic about teaching which i live because some teachers are like this is just my paycheck and do not care.,Class 0
the topic that i am very familiar with would be about forces and gravity.,Class 0
"also, i'm a visual learner, so the lab will help me learn more about the topic i learn from the lecture.",Class 0
for most of us here it is to graduate with a degree from a higher learning institution so that we may gain a job and finally make money to support ourselves.,Class 0
i have never taken a physics course in my life and it makes me very anxious because there are a number of people that have seen what we are covering previously and i have never seen any of it.,Class 0
each experiment in this class helps me to improve my knowledge in physics and physics is important because it helps us to understand our world better and even improve life by giving us technologies.,Class 0
"physics will allow me to understand concepts like distance, speed, and motion, which are involved in daily life, so it will broaden my understanding of the world overall.",Class 0
i'm only taking this class because i have to for my major physics is actually my least favorite part of science.,Class 0
"mostly, i am in this sci class so that i can get the best mastery of physics 111 topics and raise my gpa. without ever having taken a physics class, i do have some anxiety about the new material and applying complex math to some of the material.",Class 0
"im here because i dont want to be struggling in my life in the future, i dont want to be in low income.",Class 0
overall i am here taking a college course to obtain a degree in microbiology and work as a clinical laboratory scientist.,Class 0
this will be the time for me to learn more about what causes some objects to move and solving math problems using physics.,Class 0
i think it will increase the magnitude of the impact on others lives.,Class 0
"i am a second year student at sf state, major in computer science.",Class 0
"also, i think that college is a good experience.",Class 0
i took the lab last semester too and passed but i struggled passing the lecture because i didn't do too well on the exams.,Class 0
"therefore, i decided to switch back to my very original plan to study biology.",Class 0
how we are trying to find life.,Class 0
why did i chose to take a career path that requires this course?,Class 0
now a days there arent many good paying jobs that hire a person with just a high school diploma unless you get lucky.,Class 0
however if im being honest i do like physics more than my major and would have become a physics major if the pay of my civil engineering major didnt convince me otherwise.,Class 0
honestly i am here because i have to be here.,Class 0
"therefore, this class will help me in depth of why everything happens the way it does.",Class 0
"building off that, in essence, i am in this course to complete the graduation requirements for my major.",Class 0
"i hope after taking this course this semester that i at least get something out of it, anything, even as small as knowing a moon phase.",Class 0
i needed to take this course since my major requires it.,Class 0
i just probably would not take this course or any other physics course if it werent required.,Class 0
though i also heard from a number of employers that cs graduates often can't code their way out of a paper bag.the actual cs knowledge you need for a job can be learned in a few months.,Class 0
"well, first and foremost i need to go into the stem field because i am a mechanical engineering major.",Class 0
i'm not sure if you're asking why am i here at sf state or just on this planet in general.,Class 0
"i am a student in university for a reason, that reason being to be able to succeed in my future career and lifestyle.",Class 0
i am passionate and educated on the subject.,Class 0
"i can honestly say this is one of the hardest classes ive taken so far, since i had trouble understanding since day one lecture.",Class 0
my biggest source of influence has come from my family and the people i surround myself with.,Class 0
i find physics very difficult to learn and study but it also brings curiosity to my mind.,Class 0
"i have always been intimidated by physics, but i am excited to learn the material and finally get an understanding to the laws and methods that i have seen.",Class 0
we also use physics to help better understand earthquakes and the displacement of the ground from tectonic activity.,Class 0
i was not planning on being a biology major from the start so i never thought i would be taking physics again but i am excited to tackle this course and learn more about physics.,Class 0
it allows us to dig deeper into each subject and truly understand the things we might have missed before.,Class 0
"growing up, i always had an interest in literature, and then music.",Class 0
"i have taken the prerequisite course to this, and i am currently enrolled in the lecture portion of the class.",Class 0
i decided to come to sfsu to spend these last 2 years of my bachelors degree as focused as possible with no distractions to hold me back from reaching my goal.,Class 0
23209why am i here?,Class 0
i feel university can help me accomplish that and so far it has.,Class 0
"im not a great person that actually studies so, this class is literally perfect because we go over a lot without doing it all by myself or procrastinating.",Class 0
"but more specifically, i came to sf state to finish up my ba degree and to play for the men's basketball team here.",Class 0
"yesica onofre fletesseptember 2, 2020reflective journaling 1""why am i here?"" i think everyone has a different purpose to why they are here today.",Class 0
"i was scared that i would not understand anything, but im doing better than i thought.",Class 0
having practice problems and discussions with fellow classmates about class material helps me to review class material that i may miss or not understand fully.,Class 0
"though these obstacles may be tough, i try my best to push through because i know i can.",Class 0
and i wanted to be considered a full time student so she recommended i take the support class for chem 115 and biol 240 so i can have 12 units.,Class 0
i then chose to go to college in san francisco because it was a city i always loved ever since the first time i went i fell in love and its a place where i wanted to learn more.,Class 0
"it could be worse though, at least i don't have any 8 ams. this is my first lab course that feels like a real lab course, so i am very excited to see where this goes!",Class 0
physics happens to be a branch of education of my cs degree so that's a majority of the reason i'm taking the class.,Class 0
"i am in the sci class for chemistry, because i feel like it will help my understanding of the chemistry concepts.",Class 0
i feel like i am doing a lot of the handson stuff that we never got to do during the lecture class.,Class 0
i am here so i can walk across att park and experience graduating there.,Class 0
other than that i dont know why i am here other than that.,Class 0
"luckily, he told me he would always be there for my brothers and i when the time to buy a house would come.",Class 0
"sci 230 gives me more time to review everything and let it sink it, or to go over questions with everyone else.",Class 0
"another reason why i took this class if i am being honest is because since this class deals with my major, i know some things about astronomy so i thought it would be the easiest lab class to take.",Class 0
i took this sci coarse because i have no prior knowledge of physics.,Class 0
"based on my understanding of how i learn so far, i think that i am more of a listen, write it down, and speak it type of learner.",Class 0
im also taking this class because space and astronomy have interested me ever since i was little and i want to be able to answer my questions i had when i was younger.,Class 0
to live life to its fullest and see where life takes me.,Class 0
i really started being interested in astronomy in 6th grade when i was at science camp.,Class 0
i use the understanding of forces to create the leveling effect without having to drill walls and be removable.,Class 0
"also, because a different person might describe it differently than the professor.",Class 0
hopefully i met the word count.,Class 0
"although i haven't experienced another ""season"" yet, i am already worried about missing out on my beautiful ohio autumn.",Class 0
i am also here because i made a choice to study computer engineering and not nursing because of how impacting it was and my interest in computer since i was young.,Class 0
i am pursuing medicine because i love to understand how the body works.,Class 0
"also, another reason i wanted to take physics is because i want to be a music producer and i know that dealing with frequencies and sound waves is a big part of that so i figured that understanding the science behind it would help me improve.",Class 0
the advisors emphasized that they highly recommend we take this supplemental class if our schedules allow us to add it.,Class 0
that is why i will try my best to understand the concepts i am being taught.,Class 0
"however, so far i have been able to understand the material better.",Class 0
but recently ive ventured into starting up my own food business thats based around my culture.,Class 0
"to get a better grade, get help with the lectures.",Class 0
"i asked around my study group at the time what classes should i take, they suggested a try sci class to complement my general chemistry 2 class.",Class 0
"since i didn't get accepted into the architecture schools i applied for, i decided to move towards san francisco state in order to study computer science.",Class 0
i tend to get so distracted by the fun things in life and forget that the hard stuff is what will define my future.,Class 0
physics is difficult for me and i need all the help that i can to fix my struggle with it.,Class 0
a lot of things have changed in the past couple of years but i do intend to be very interactive and participate during lab.,Class 0
not like im here against my will or anything.,Class 0
"i have a passion for babies and i myself when i was born, was born in a car, so i was incubated for about a month because i did not have much oxygen, so it was a scary moment for both my parents.",Class 0
i continue to remain here because of my fight to improve the educational institution and create a safer and stronger support system for future generations to come.,Class 0
i do enjoy going to the planetarium and having the extra push to look up at the moon and stars.,Class 0
i am excited to go to the planetarium by myself and look at the stars.,Class 0
"although the physics class is not so bad to understand, the lab is difficult to do because we apply our knowledge from the class into the experiments we do in the lab.",Class 0
medical schools want to see that not only have you taken labs required for your major but labs outside of school is very important as well.,Class 0
"i am here because i have a dream, and in order to reach that dream i have to make certain steps.",Class 0
danica micaelscience 115journal 1 why am i here?,Class 0
i am a hands on learner so i truly feel like these labs are going to be a bit hard for me because there is no actual one on one face to face with the professor.,Class 0
i am here because i enjoy studying astronomy and physics.,Class 0
i just want to be here for my loved ones and be able to do what i love and to not have any stress or worry in the world.,Class 0
this class will also help me review and better prepare myself for when we have exams.,Class 0
im taking sci because i honestly think you can help me i took physics one sci and it helped a ton.,Class 0
some answers may be from justifying this is my goal in life and it is set that way.,Class 0
college is expected to move forth in a career.,Class 0
"when i took physics in high school, i really liked the class and found it to be really interesting.",Class 0
why am i here?sometimes i find myself asking that very question.,Class 0
"i believe that purpose is to see which people were caring and nice, and which people are mean and a threat to society.",Class 0
"though, it is fun to actually play with charges and currents.",Class 0
reflection 1 why am i here?,Class 0
also this is the only class time that work for my schedule.,Class 0
don't get me wrong.,Class 0
"i've taken si before and i went into it just thinking about a study group type of class, and it kinda is like that but i've discovered it's more than just studying.",Class 0
i havent chosen a major but ive thought about going into biology or perhaps another kind of science so taking this class seemed like a good idea.,Class 0
"i took physics in high school and really enjoyed it, so i am hoping that the experience extends into college.",Class 0
"i find physics to be quite difficult, however i'm taking it in order to have an understanding for it so that i am able to apply it into my computer science work in the future.",Class 0
i wanted to learn more about the things and enjoyed and how people were able to design the mechanics of a game.,Class 0
"i picked this degree to use the knowledge gained to create, build, and develop business in the future.",Class 0
i also have always been better at math and sciences than my other studies.,Class 0
college is a place where you can further your knowledge and learn new skills.,Class 0
i do not need to and do not want to understand exactly why things do the things they do.,Class 0
"in any case, i intend to keep moving forward in this path and to make any necessary changes as the situation seems fit.",Class 0
i see dozens of people sitting next to me all the time but we do not have the time or opportunity to socialize with one another.,Class 0
"i'm partially here because this class is for my major, but i am also motivated to learn something new.",Class 0
"and not so much as academically, but learn life lessons, values and experience what it is like to be human.",Class 0
"just from my impression of the last fall semester, physics is pretty difficult for me especially when it comes to calculus.",Class 0
i really hope that everything i get to learn about in this class would be helpful to be applied to our everyday life situations.,Class 0
the second reason is that it is really interesting and useful to know a lot of the stuff that you would learn when getting a stem degree.,Class 0
week one hit me hard but i think i will bounce back this week against hollywood.,Class 0
"despite being my first day, i am still honored to be able to have a seat.",Class 0
i ended up choosing this school because of the affordability and location.,Class 0
one reason is the base housing allowance is the highest in california.,Class 0
i dont have much of a want to be here but a need to be here as physics is a concrete foundation in learning other topics.,Class 0
"three years later, i came back to this school to finish what i have started and i am not stopping and definitely do not plan to repeat any of my major required courses.",Class 0
"i am at a point in my life where i only have one goal and that is to do well in school, so that i can later go into a profession where i feel happy and satisfied with my life.",Class 0
"even though i am a biochemistry major, whenever i take physics i learn so much about every day life things and it makes my biochem classes make more sense sometimes.",Class 0
understand my purpose.,Class 0
as a computer science major i understand the importance of understanding physics but do not see myself utilizing all of the formulas and information i learn here in the future.,Class 0
for that reason i am taking physics because i enjoy studying the topic.,Class 0
"i am passionate about using what i learn here to improve the world, because i believe that to combat global warming we must create something revolutionary.",Class 0
"i didnt have time for the lab, therefore, i am took it this semester.",Class 0
it had always given me the impression that it was hard.,Class 0
i decided to still transfer despite sfsu not being my first choice.,Class 0
whenever im struggling i know i can fall back on science.,Class 0
i think the reason why i am in this class is that i hope to learn more physics knowledge.,Class 0
whatever it is that i end up doing i hope that it is something that makes me happy.,Class 0
"i was supposed to take this class last semester, but i had a lot on my plate.",Class 0
i have never taken a sci course so this will be the first semester where i participate in this type of class.,Class 0

to achieve this i have enrolled in this class to lighten the weight of chemistry 215.,Class 0
a greater essence of why im here would be because i would like to receive my degree in accounting.,Class 0
it has been a long road but i will definitely pay off in the end.,Class 0
this class will help me have an understanding of the topic.,Class 0
a big goal but it is also what motivates me to continue my daily routine.,Class 0
"it seems like a daunting task, but i think i can manage.",Class 0
so i am here in this class because it is a requirement for my major.,Class 0

i find this question often appearing.,Class 0
i see why they want me to go to school and i want to make them proud.,Class 0
i wanted to somewhere not too far and not too close.,Class 0

im really glad i did.,Class 0
"i think that while having a degree does not guarantee you a better job after you graduate, you can use the resources provided by the school to get opportunities.",Class 0
im taking this class because i am double majoring in environmental science and civil engineering.,Class 0
well i am here now because of her and because i need to have a better personal understanding in chemistry because of my major is under the science field.,Class 0
i had a hard time understanding this material when i was a sophomore in high school and i think the stress and hesitation to take this class stemmed off of my negative experience in high school.,Class 0

"i really love working with children, thats why i am becoming a pediatrician.",Class 0
i was afraid that she will forget me one day and i told my mom about san francisco state university is also a college for business.,Class 0
"i feel like i'm here in life to just sorta live simply, and to see what i can do for others.",Class 0
"it was hard for me to remember things such as key terms and concepts, and so i'm taking it now because i assume that the pacing is a lot better, and the teaching will be a lot smoother than before.",Class 0

i wasnt paying or doing enough to pass to the class so i ended with a d.,Class 0
this is also a requirement for my major in order for me to graduate on time.,Class 0
i am someone who always questions everything and pondering on things your typical person wouldn't and i think its because i am maybe an old soul.,Class 0
the reason i did not think about taking it at first was because my professor did not explain it very well and i had never even heard of a sci course.,Class 0
i haven't taken a physics course since high school therefore i'm a little rusty.,Class 0
im also a big fan of the universe and have lots of curiosity towards why earth does what it does and how this so called big bang created all of life.,Class 0

i am here to meet the course requirements needed for my major.,Class 0
this class has really helped me because i feel like since the teachers are past students of that class they help us to understand the ways of how the class is carried out and also how we are supposed to expect from the class.,Class 0
this is why i am a biology major.,Class 0
"the first three years i was an apprentice, and i learned a lot about my trade.",Class 0
physics is mother fucking hard as shit.,Class 0
"i think on a bigger scale, the reason why i am here at sfsu is because i knew i wanted to expand my worldview and decided that going to a school far from my hometown would benefit me because it would allow me to interact and meet new people and give me the opportunity to make longlasting and meaningful connections.",Class 0
"it's close to home where i can commute easily, i can work a lot if need be, but i also get some of the same experiences of being in ""real college"".",Class 0

i have never been good at it either.,Class 0
"i am excited about that, but i bet its still as hard.",Class 0
i believe that sci 111 will help me get there.,Class 0
"not going to lie, i fooled around a lot in the beginning and it took me quite a while to find my footing.",Class 0
being able to lift as many worries off of people is something that i find joy in.,Class 0

im here for one reason which is to learn something new every day.,Class 0
i am a fan of science and i am upset with all the antiscience bias that the world is seemingly going through right now and the best way to combat that is through education and enlightenment.,Class 0
since i know how to these classes work as a stem major i look forward to taking more of these classes.,Class 0
"so far, im enjoying physics.",Class 0
but i'm thinking of adding chemistry as my minor since i need to take organic chemistry.,Class 0
i'm in sci 230 because i intend to use as many resources as possible to find success in bio 230.,Class 0
to keep striving at being a better person each and every day .,Class 0

"it is not easy to obtain this degree, so in order to get this degree i will need to put in hard work.",Class 0
i then transferred into a 4 year university in southern california (california state los angeles) and completed 2 years there.,Class 0
i specifically chose this class during the time that it occurs because it was the only class that would fit in my current schedule.,Class 0
but i am here so my mindset is now to take advantage of the situation that i am in and learn as much as i can.,Class 0
i think i am here from a combination of chances and choices.,Class 0
"but anyways thats about it for my way, writing from my stream of consciousness is a bit hard cause i'm like what do i even write about?",Class 0
"hi bryce!my name is mariella and the reason that im here is because one its a required requirement for physical chemistry, my major is chemistry, and two i enjoy the concept of physics but i do find it very hard to take in.",Class 0
"i have never taken physics before, just because when i hear the word physics it personally fills me with dread.",Class 0
"as unattainable as it has seemed at times, i've trained to maintain the idea that my dream is indeed attainable.",Class 0
i would like to learn other topics in relation to physics.,Class 0
i hope to graduate with my degree and run for public office.,Class 0
i have always dreamed of playing basketball professionally but reality hit in where i am still working on my game while needing to find another career as a backup plan.,Class 0
school is very rough for my major this semester so i dont feel too happy about my choice to postpone this class until now since it takes up so much time and isnt something relevant to my major.,Class 0
i am not certain why i am here on earth.,Class 0
"i have always been interested in space and have loved learning about the subject, but i never refined my interest until college, when i chose to take astronomy as my physical science, which was also a no brainer for me.",Class 0
"by taking this astronomy lab course, it allows me to experiment and learn about polaris and also how to find the distance of a start and its altitudes and azimuth.",Class 0
therefore it sparked my interest to learn more about how things works and their relationship.,Class 0
"well, since i was a kid i have been fascinated with the way things work.",Class 0
as well as just gaining an understanding of the world and how things work.,Class 0
im here because i sort of know whats going in astronomy and try to pay attention.,Class 0
i have an interest in learning physics since i have never been in a setting where i actually took the class and the only prior knowledge i have is from watching the big bang theory and learning from there which is not the best source.,Class 0
becoming a doctor is something ive always dreamt of and this and being here right now is a path for me to get there one day and be successful.,Class 0
"my current goal for my life is to be a researcher, and to be honest i really dont know what to yet.",Class 0
chemistry has been kicking my butt since i first got to college and with that i was really afraid to start my physics requirements.,Class 0
"to me, physics is also fascinating because it not only explains the structure of how objects function, but it really also explains things like how the double helix is a double helix and why another structure doesnt exist for dna, how light is reflected and what kinds of visible light are truly seen by the human eye, and so much more.",Class 0
my back is always sore and my arms and legs are covered with bruises and scratches.,Class 0
if i could live in a specific place for the rest of my life it would be here.,Class 0
"i'm doing this honestly because i need a job that i am content with, a job that lets me embrace a passion that is slowly burning brighter and hopefully never diminishes.",Class 0
another reason why i'm here is because of the college experience.,Class 0
finding my purpose to live is an ongoing thought that i dont think about everyday but is a thought in the back of my head when i wake up every morning.,Class 0

i do however sometimes also have a hard time understanding the concept as i have no idea what's happening.,Class 0
"after having a successful time in sci both emotionally and gradewise, i knew that it would be advantageous to rejoin a sci class this semester.",Class 0
"secondly, i am here at sfsu because i wanted to get away from home to learn how to be on my own.",Class 0
i like having extra practice with problems i expect will be on the exam so having a course like sci will really help me to be more prepared and ready for what the lecture will bring.,Class 0
i would personally say that after covid started and everything went online last semester i kind of just checked out since i was so used to being in class in person.,Class 0
i am excited to learn from the experiments we are going to do in the class.,Class 0
im here because this class is a requirement for my major.,Class 0
having this class allows me to set aside a designated time every week to better understand topics that we have already covered in the parent course or to prepare ourselves by working on material that we may encounter in the future.,Class 0
i am here in this class also to learn more about physics because to be honest i feel like i know very little about physics.,Class 0
i am here for many reasons.,Class 0
"this is all the superficial aspects of life, the american dream so to speak.",Class 0
"however, being able to attend the labs every wednesday has helped sharpen my understanding about astronomy and, in ways, has cultivated my attentiveness about our world and everything outside of it that expands to space.",Class 0
"i wanted to get my writing course outof the way, but unfortunately i was too late on preregistering and all the spots for those classes weretaken, so i settled with physics.",Class 0
i am a bio major so a lot of my courses through college will be science classes and need prerequisite to read higher up in that field as chem has many different courses but needs prerequisite to unlock them.also i am taking calculus and chemistry and these courses kind of go hand in hand so it helps taking physics to get a better grasp of topics.,Class 0
but i don't think that's the case at all.,Class 0
so id want to fund a course that would teach more computer science to kids either in a curriculum or at an after school program.,Class 0
natural selection and whatnot.,Class 0
"i like to think that he knows as long as we are in this together, we will make it to the finish line.",Class 0
why am i here? i am in physics 232: general physics with calculus ii laboratory for many valid reasons.,Class 0
"personally, im doing civil engineering with a focus on transportation, and i got into the stem field personally for hopes of financial success coming with the degree and due to my fondness of engineering in general.",Class 0
so why am i here?,Class 0
i am here because the only thing i want fo be when i am older is successful.,Class 0
"however, i am also here to improve myself on both physics knowledge and practical problems solving skills.",Class 0
being here at san francisco state gives me an opportunity to get an education.,Class 0
so here i am (:,Class 0
"if you think about it, there really is no true purpose to life except to live and to die.",Class 0
i thought that this class can really help me hone in my math skills.,Class 0
i'm here because i'm afraid of failing physics and i'm hoping this class will help me succeed in passing it.,Class 0
it allows for me to ask questions and have a more oneonone experience with a smaller class.,Class 0
"for me personally, i have chosen to try to be a positive effect on those who i am connected with.",Class 0
"i forgot where i read this, but many educators say for every unit you take you should be studying one hour per unit your class is worth.",Class 0
"this leads me to take another sci class, one for a level up chemistry course than i have previously taken.",Class 0
why am i here in this school?,Class 0
im here to break that cycle of people not going to college.,Class 0
"i am here, in this class for a few different reasons.",Class 0
i think i'm still on my way of figuring that out as the rest of us are.,Class 0
"now if the question is referring to why am i attending sfsu in san francisco, ca. i would say that i am here because this city really captured me ever since i came to visit, ive always thought it was amazing city.",Class 0
i am here because i never took the physics lab portion of the class until now 2 years after taking the course originally.,Class 0
"at the same time, physics is often involved in our daily life.",Class 0
"like many, i really hate school but i actually have a lot of trouble with physics.",Class 0
it was not until someone came in our physics lecture and started explaining the sci course.,Class 0
i used to be so embarrassed to share my dreams with others because they would shoot them down.,Class 0
this is no excuse just a realization and current confidence entering a course containing new subject matter.,Class 0
"with labs, i can 'make more friends' because most of the time when i do not understand a step then its easier for me to ask a colleague rather than the instructor.",Class 0
physics 101 is a class im taking to complete a ge requirement under the laboratory sciences.,Class 0
they feel like small little flashbacks when i try to think back.,Class 0
i really want to be able to make a change in people's lives.,Class 0
this turned out to be a great decision.,Class 0
as for sf state i wanted to experience san francisco state.,Class 0
i am nervous about how i'll perform in this class because i tend to struggle with my science courses.,Class 0
when i was a junior and senior in high school i didnt know what i wanted to do.,Class 0
i found it interesting and fun even when it's challenging so science has always been my favorite subject.,Class 0
i started my first semester of college with an astronomy lecture and i got a taste of being a college student.,Class 0
"when i was child, i read a biography of galileo galilei.",Class 0
all they did was sacrifice everything to have better opportunities for their children.,Class 0
im here because i want to improve my studies in chemistry.,Class 0
"i am infatuated with space and other planets far from us, so i wanted to further my study of astronomy by taking this class.",Class 0
ive heard how difficult biology could be and i figured taking two hours out of my day could be the difference between passing the class and failing it.,Class 0
why am i here?there's a lot of reasons as to why im in this class and in this university.,Class 0
i think it for sure helps with ones critical thinking and problem solving.,Class 0
i need because it's required or else i wouldn't be in this particular class.,Class 0
"a class is more than just a requirement, rather it is a door that leads you to a new understanding of the world around you.",Class 0
"with this in mind, i hope i am able to apply what i will learn in this class to my future classes and career.",Class 0
obviously it can help me further my education in the field of science and help prepare me for future courses.,Class 0
"however, most of my classmates are not good it physics or other science subjects, including me.",Class 0
"my purpose in life, on this planet, here on earth, at this very day and age is to live to serve others.",Class 0
"while i know that pre calculus is a prerequisite for this class, she did an awful job at explaining the concepts.",Class 0
"i was the product of a divorced family, my mother was a bartender, my dad wasnt around much, and all of my brothers and sisters were half brothers and half sisters who were at least 8 years older than me.",Class 0
i enjoy going into the labs handson and having to be in a collaborative environment.,Class 0
i am at sfsu because i hated the idea of staying in my hometown of san jose but i also didn't want to move super far away from all my friends who stayed in san jose for school.,Class 0
"as a kinesiology major i want and need to know how our body moves, the limitations of our body, and how our body reacts or its relationship with the world (such as gravity).",Class 0
sitting here in my desk doing a physics lab online is something i never though about and never thought i would do this.,Class 0
ive accepted that i can do science and that has been a journey all in its self.,Class 0
"however, i believe i have found mine.",Class 0
"however, i need to make it through a long and difficult path of schooling to pursue this dream.",Class 0
theres a bit of resentment because its a lower division course that im having to take on some mixups between my transfers from a previous school but its not really targeted at anyone in particular besides educational administration.,Class 0
now i am here in this class because i am willing to do what it takes to get to that spot.,Class 0
"at first, i thought that i was here because i had to be here.",Class 0
"on the way towards getting a major, i get to take this physics class which will help me to understand the laws that govern the universe.",Class 0
do we all really have to be working everyday in our lives?,Class 0

well thats why im here,Class 0
"that is the reason as to ""why i am here""...",Class 0
i waited quite some time to take physics in my undergrad because ive had bad experiences in the past and the many times i enrolled in physics the professors i was stuck with were some of the worst professors ive ever taken here at sf state.,Class 0
"this would cause a sharp pain in my elbow whenever i would do pushups, bench press, or simply bending my arm would result in a cracking like noise.",Class 0
"there's several reason why i'm here, mainly is because i'm enroll in this class and i have to present in the class to follow the lecture.",Class 0
i am looking forward to experiencing the interesting things in this class in the near future.,Class 0
"i enjoy not just knowing that something operates a certain way just because, but rather understanding the underlying factors that causes and aids in the work being done to make something perform the way it is.",Class 0

i believe the small classes that dont seem to mean anything is a lot of knowledge to work with.,Class 0
"so, i am here because i could not enroll in another physics class and by random chance i ended up in your class.",Class 0
"i have to be able to see and understand the different concepts which i learn in my different classes not just physics necessarily, but rather all the courses which i am taking.",Class 0
i am the friend you come to when you need advice.,Class 0
i am grateful that i am able to be surrounded by classmates that are so passionate about their career choice and so kind in helping each other.,Class 0
"for example, there are two different organic chemistry teachers right now so some of the other students can teach us about topics we havent learned yet and vice verse.",Class 0
i enjoyed the class but it wasn't something i saw myself doing as a profession.,Class 0
"i am here because i want to have a good career, i want to be able to provide for myself and for my family.",Class 0
i will definitely fulfill my schooling requirements so hopefully i can be the best i can be in my career.,Class 0
but because i took chem last semester most of the material is still fresh.,Class 0

im most excited for the experiments because i like being handson so its a little sad that most of our labs are going to be done online with stimulations.,Class 0
im in this class because i know i struggle with math a little bit and it doesnt help that we only have an hour class when im used to learning things in a longer period of time.,Class 0
"for bio majors, we need to take physics 111 and then if we want to, we can build off of it and proceed to the next level of physics.",Class 0
"i could go much more in to the actions i did to get in here, but that's not really interesting.",Class 0

i am required to take this class for my major but also to reach my goals such as attending med school.,Class 0
"often times in the super 'stem' classes like bio or chem, the kids are so competitive and it becomes this glorified competition, not about that.",Class 0
my professor mentioned something about a sci class when it first started but i did not even think about taking the class.,Class 0
another reason i am taking this class is that it would make my life much easier if i strengthen my math skills.,Class 0
if there is something that i love more than anything besides my friends and family it is animals.,Class 0
"second, i also need this class as a prerequisite for my engr 205: electric circuits which im planning to take in spring semester.",Class 0
im taking the physics lab because im also enrolled in the physics lecture on mwf. i'm also taking it because in high school i took preap physics and i really enjoyed it but it was kind of difficult for me as well.,Class 0
i get extra practice and help to understand the problems i have difficulty with and just the material in general.,Class 0

"lately i've been feeling very discouraged, especially since the whole covid 19 and everything going on.",Class 0
it's almost like we are being forced to follow these curriculums in order to learn about sciences.,Class 0
"everyone have beliefs of their own of what they believe in like opinions, theories or yourself and if you believe in yourself that means you are trying to achieve more in life and have a purpose for yourself, i mean everyone believes in that we were born or put on earth for a reason like a purpose, i personally agree but were all not to sure why were here, but there's one thing i can say and that is to find your own purpose or dream that you want to do and achieve.",Class 0
"my name is ianna, i was added into lab last night so this is the first session i have attended.",Class 0
i am also taking this class because it is a requirement.,Class 0

i chose taking physics lab is because my major is industrial design.,Class 0
"after thinking for awhile, she told me to read the books on planets because they were, kind of similar. listening to her instructions, i began to read about jupiter,mars, and saturn.",Class 0
"by taking this course, it will give me a better understanding over concepts and formulas that i may have or havent gone over in my lecture for chem 215 class.",Class 0
my interests and life experiences have ended me up here.,Class 0
the last time i took a physics course was in highschool and i was quite often confused while not covering some details through experiments like i wanted to.,Class 0

it's a breadth vs.,Class 0
my favorite toy growing up was a doctor's kit of toys for children but as i have grown older i realized that my calling was not to work with people in the medical field.,Class 0
my bootcamp peers who were getting the job offers already had years of experience hobby programming (with projects to show for it) or had a college degree in something.,Class 0
it is a bit difficult question to answer.,Class 0
ive been having a quarterlife crisis since i was in high school.,Class 0
people just live life and go through certain situations but every single event is due to another person's action along with your own.,Class 0
i am very grateful and blessed to even be able to take such a course.,Class 0
in order for me to do well in this class i need to first show up and listen attentively and complete all asignments on time.,Class 0
it is also very difficult for me to understand since it does not spark my interests.,Class 0
"when i first got started in science i was in elementary, my dad and i entered in the school science contest for fun and we ended up winning.",Class 0
when drawing up floorplans and starting construction it is important to understand the physics aspects of the building properties.,Class 0

"first of all, it is mandatory and i do not want to fail.",Class 0
"but overall, i am here because i need extra help with cell bio.",Class 0
the one goal i have for myself in life is to just be happy.,Class 0
im kind of confused.,Class 0
that's a great question.,Class 0
for the past 2 years i have been trying to get accepted in california maritime academy.,Class 0
personally the idea of study groups isnt that appealing to me.,Class 0
"i can calculate it with money, gallons, and miles.",Class 0
for the sake of answering questions that might appear as a result of such an answer that i have provided; i will indulge thee with hypotheticals.,Class 0
i think the reason why i am here taking this class is mainly that this is required for my graduate program.,Class 0
though i would much rather have a vacation type of summer that is currently not possible.,Class 0
i am here at san francisco state university because i have been working my entire educational life to attend college.,Class 0
"as for why i am here, i have felt that i have always been here for other people.",Class 0
i am here solely to learn.,Class 0
i am here in san francisco because it is one of my favorite places ever.,Class 0
i am physiology to prepare for my inevitable application to california physician assistant programs.,Class 0
i also needed to take a physics class for my major and i am taking the sci class to boost my grade.,Class 0
"i would like to major in computer science, but i enjoy the handson approach to projects and tech.",Class 0
trying to sleep earlier.,Class 0
by being in this class i am also able to apply what i learn in lecture to real life models and cases.,Class 0
i am here in this class at least to gain more knowledge on a science subject that i am very limited in.,Class 0
"whenever i had a science exam, i enjoyed studying the material.",Class 0
"although i had taken physics during high school, i never really excelled in it because i found it too difficult to understand fully.",Class 0
"since, the class is a lot smaller than the seminar it is easier to ask questions.",Class 0
so i would expect to learn more in depth of how motionthermodynamics works so it can help me in my daily life and the future.,Class 0
without the add code i would have been forced to drop both this lab and lecture because these to classes have to be coenrolled from what i have read.,Class 0
i am the one who always remains calm.,Class 0
"i like learning and attempting new things, which is what physics is to me at least.",Class 0
"i also have chances to observe realistically from the class about the earth, univers, stars , galaxy, and so on.",Class 0

"this is my last semester here, and i found out that i needed this course to graduate.",Class 0
"in high school, many of my friends were taking physics and ap physics and i would hear about the topics while they were studying.",Class 0
physics why am i here?,Class 0
"in addition to why i am here, its because this lab interest me the most compared to any other lab, i have no experience nor did anyone told me the difficulty.",Class 0
"if i am to be in the medical field, i would of course, have to take science classes and prevail.",Class 0
with this help i will be able to create a good base understanding of the material and build upon it with new future topics in following semesters.,Class 0
"i used to think that there wasnt a real place for me in school and barely skated by in it, and now im making up for where i was before.",Class 0
i believe this question could be answered in many different way.,Class 0
all i had to do was to put in the effort and stay on course with my goal and i was destined to be the person that i was meant to be.,Class 0
i am here because of a variety of reasons.,Class 0
i definitely do not know what im doing but im not the only one.,Class 0
"i am here, taking phys 112 because it is a required class for my major, biology.",Class 0
i also want to be more prepared for the labs for the semester and know whats going on and what i'm doing during the labs and be more prepared for it.,Class 0
"of california, san francisco, and get a good job upon graduating.",Class 0
i chose to come to sfsu in order to still be close to home and limit debt as much as possible so early on in my life of learning.,Class 0
"physics was very difficult to understand when i was thrown with equations that didn't work when trying to solve problems, and the only way teachers taught it is by abiding by the equations and not explaining the conceptual portion as well as they should be.",Class 0
"if that was not the case i probably would not be sitting here in this class as i write about the topic simply asking, why am i here?",Class 0
the 2 things that are my main motivators.,Class 0
i thought it couldn't hurt anything and it would just be an extra study session that i would get college credit for.,Class 0
"i think i do better around people, but im still very confused about what i should do with my life.",Class 0
but both these are really good tutoring sessions because the students teaching know the tricks in order to survive the main course.,Class 0
"in terms of being in san francisco state, i am here because i was accepted here and it is located in san francisco which called to me when i was in high school.",Class 0
in the first two weeks i thought online calculus two would be easy to learn on my own.,Class 0
i like the lab portions.,Class 0
"though, i think its okay not to know the origins of life or why were here.",Class 0
"i think physics is an interesting subject based on the science programs i have watched like nova, and i think it would be helpful to take a class to better understand the programs.",Class 0
"firstly, i have a pretty big gap between my biology and ochem lectures so taking this course would minimize it.",Class 0
i attend san francisco state university to help my future self in my leading to my career.,Class 0
"being able to cherish others and value others is something that gives me a reason to care about life, and i dont feel that i should just live a life for myself since i feel it wouldnt be much of a meaningful life if im only fulfilling things that make me satisfied.",Class 0
but i like to do some experiments that are funny and interesting since i like to learn how things move.,Class 0
thinking about how we are only floating in space with who knows who else out there has always been in the back of my mind.,Class 0
"i don't know what to expect for physics since the last physics course i took was in high school, which was more of a tutorial period then and actual class.",Class 0
i also love solving problems.,Class 0
i hope to understand physics and maybe one day be able to say that i understand at least the basics.,Class 0
the reason for why i am here is because i need to go get my degree.,Class 0
i was on academic probation last semester and didn't know about the hold that was keeping me from adding classes to this semester so i had a late start with the classes i wanted.,Class 0
"that second math class was not offered at my community college though, so i was going to take it at this institution no matter what.",Class 0
"in addition, i wouldn't probably feel so tired by the end of the 3 hours and still want to remain focused.",Class 0
i want to give inspiring life stories to my future generational family members.,Class 0
"i had taken the phys 222 last semester but didn't pass, because of absent.",Class 0
"also, in my opinion, physics, biology and chemistry are all intertwined with each other.",Class 0
"however, this lab class provides me more opportunity to understand and explores the daily life of physics.",Class 0
i guess i cannot answer this question because i have been very doubtful lately and do not know where i am headed in the future.,Class 0
i got to sfsu for my passion for filmmaking.,Class 0
my favorite part is learning about extraterrestrial being.,Class 0
"so, i scammed my friend to come with me to the first class because i did not want to go alone.",Class 0
"i was never big on english class in hs and coming here and realizing that my major was just going to be a one essay after another, i couldn't do it.",Class 0
"during my countless hours volunteering at hospitals to the countless hours being admitted, i feel like i would be comfortable to pursue a career.",Class 0
"since i need to pass the lecture and lab, i am here to learn and apply these concepts to my major.",Class 0
although i did not ask for this process at this time...it came to me at the perfect timing.,Class 0
i want more than anything to be a surgeon.,Class 0
i also understand that this is a relatively important class as physics is found all around us and not just in math formulas we learn in class.,Class 0
having labs with the lecture courses generally help me apply some concepts in the real world and lets me get to know some of my classmates even more.,Class 0
the reason i am here has several layers.,Class 0
this means that i am going to need to understand some of the material that i learn in physics for my specific major.,Class 0
"before taking this class, i have not taken a physics class since my freshman year of high school, which was about 6 12 years ago.",Class 0
college education brings forth lots of opportunities (or so ive heard) that have the ability to change your life.,Class 0
anyway i think astrophysics majors are so cool and so intelligent.,Class 0
i originally got into san francisco state as a physics major but decided to change it because i plan on transferring to another school in the netherlands and they only offer an astronomy major for english speakers.,Class 0
i love coming to class with people having the same drive and motivation as i do to learn the required material and helping others out if they run into trouble.,Class 0
i think it's really amazing when i see someone or become acquainted with someone that can have a conversation with anyone about anything.,Class 0
this class has a lot of value in many ways and i am glad to be taking it.,Class 0
"this has been something i always needed to work on, and i feel like this class with not only help me get organized and understand topics and find out why the way to solving these are different, it will also help me to understand where it starts and it would be a nice midweek review of concepts we have learned.",Class 0
"well, thats because i am a science major, specifically a bio physiology major and i must complete the introduction to physics course series in order to complete my major requirements in order to receive my degree.",Class 0
i love biology.,Class 0
i also believe that there are other types of life out there in the universe and that there are alternate universes where you made a different decision from what you made.,Class 0
the concept of physics is new to me but i am interested in learning more about it.,Class 0
sfsu was the only state university that provided me with the most financial aid and the closest home.,Class 0
i also liked the bay area and thought i could find more of my interests here.,Class 0
going to college was an easy choice for me because ive seen what could happen if you dont work hard and chase your dreams.,Class 0
it wasnt until my first semester as a junior that i realized that i saw no future for myself in business.,Class 0
i always wanted to die doing something heroic and making my last words something a long the lines of i got this.,Class 0
i believe that humans have intrinsic value and that all are made in the image of god.,Class 0
alexander chen 2192020 sci 227 why am i here?,Class 0
"when i was in high school, i was a good student of physics and was praised by many teachers.",Class 0
then after that i think i'll just participate in the rat races for the next couple of decades and hopefully i'll make the best out of it.,Class 0
i find it easier to study with a whole group of people because concepts can be learned faster with different study habits and tactics that others have.,Class 0
this class is also extremely helpful because it helps me review what i learned in lecture and use what i learned in class to solve for how to do the labs within this class.,Class 0
"however, the decision to go to college was completely up to us.",Class 0
getting a degree to me means one more tool i need to move into a career where i can have a good impact and make myself happy doing something i enjoy.,Class 0
"nonetheless, im excited to be in a lab with quite a bit of fun classmates and to be able to rely on both their help along with our professor.",Class 0
"my dad was in the military so, we moved around a little bit.",Class 0
through learning about the body and how to get stronger ive also found reasons to be more connected to this world and other people.,Class 0
chemistry so far is going pretty well i think.,Class 0
"this is helpful since it will reinforce my confidence in physics concepts, and that confidence will help me feel more at ease in research environments (specifically research labs for phd programs).",Class 0
i am here in physics class because i feel like physics is fun.,Class 0
i dont regret anything.,Class 0
physics is an interesting subject that has plenty of real world applications that are interesting and will help to learn general knowledge that will help later on in my academic journey.,Class 0
"after reading the question prompt, two responses came to mind job opportunity, and role model.",Class 0
the stem field is a bit more detail oriented and difficult compared to many other fields that are offered.,Class 0
"overall, sci slows me to fully comprehend what im learning in class and lets us meet more people in the stem field.",Class 0
estefan dinarte 9102020 phys 102 why am i here i am here because i would like to fu rther my knowledge and education.,Class 0
"since newton's epochmaking treatise on the mathematical principles of natural philosophy, physics has been an independent discipline.",Class 0
i am a person that gets most of his learning from a visual stand point.,Class 0
"the reason why i've chosen to be in stem field is because i'm facinated by math and physics, although am not excellent.",Class 0
i always wanted to study abroad.,Class 0
i like being in this study group because i get to meet new people and talk outside of the lecture.,Class 0
this is why i am here right now.,Class 0
"im not quite sure what the question is referring to but if it is in regards at where i currently live the answer would be that i am here in san francisco, ca because i decided to attend college here.",Class 0
"if i'm being honest, if this class wasn't mandatory for my major, i wouldn't be here right now simply because it wouldn't benefit me as much as taking another cs class would.",Class 0
i understand that they want to make sure that i have a certain level of academic competence by getting an excellent grade in second semester physics.,Class 0
"gravity, air resistance?",Class 0
i am here so i am knowledgeable enough to transform and create ideas and creations.,Class 0
this meant i have to pass calculus 2.,Class 0
but i can't apply it to solve the problems.,Class 0
"my class is a little slower paced, so the si class gives me at the very least an introduction to a topic that we havent gone into depth on in my lecture.",Class 0
i didnt know what to expect and i was actually really nervous to how well i was going to do.,Class 0
"also, its partially my fault.",Class 0
"physics is honestly a really hard class for me, i hate math and this is math on a second level it involves you to be more aware and it is a really fast paced class.",Class 0
"also i got into the mindset that i am choosing to be there and that is why i am here, in middle school we felt forced to go to school.",Class 0
"after my first class session in the si class, i came out with so much clarity and understanding, that there is no way i could bare skipping this class.",Class 0
"i think overall, those are the reasons that i am here.",Class 0
"a year ago, i chose to take astronomy because the other science class named intimidated me, ive never been good at science so the idea of taking biology or chemistry sounded scary.",Class 0
i have not taken chem in a good minute so some of the stuff might go over my head but i am willing to do everything i can to get the highest grade possible.,Class 0
"ive heard good things about these supplementary courses, so im hoping that i can get an a in bio with the help this class will provide me.",Class 0
"honestly, i struggle a lot with calculus 3 concepts, so sometimes i feel really behind because i always have to refresh on the basics.",Class 0
"i guess that's similar to our discussion section of our lab writeups, but i digress.",Class 0
i am glad i joined this sci course and excited to see how this year goes.,Class 0
i would have much preferred to be in one for physics or data structure but my schedule overlapped with their times.,Class 0
"despite being a biology major, i genuinely believe that understanding basic physics concepts will be applicable in my future research work.",Class 0
"it was also a really hard time for me to get through, because i was really struggling with deciding if healthcare was really the right path for me, and i felt like i was back to my old self that was feeling so inferior and not good enough from a few years ago.",Class 0
"secondly, i am curious about astronomy.",Class 0
i know learn that i need to start trying at the beginning of the class because physics builds up upon itself.,Class 0
i am here because i needed assistance in my biology class and i really noticed a difference in the way i understand and study in my biology class.,Class 0
"when i entered this class i wasnt quite sure what to expect, but ive always had an interest toward astronomy and figured i would enjoy it.",Class 0
"isn't the purpose of life, just to live it?",Class 0
this essay is meant to connect you to your purpose.,Class 0
i am here because i believe i have a purpose.,Class 0
"other than that, i don't really know why else i'm here.",Class 0
"eventually, when i attended high school, i was apart of an internship at the california academy of sciences as an education intern who would teach people about the various scientific topics that are discussed here.",Class 0
the list just keeps going and i understand that there should never be a perfect solution to everything.,Class 0
"anyways, i really like this class.",Class 0
"i know that many times we battle certain obstacles and we question why us, but i am a stronger believer that everything happens for a reason and only the strongest soldiers are put for those battles.",Class 0
"when i read why am i here, the first thing that came mind was that i am here because this lab is required to be taken while i take physic 230.",Class 0
as an intro course i hope to learn the basics of learning how to calculate motion in objects and be able to do it confidently.,Class 0
every person ive met before this point was meant to pass by me and give me some kind of influence so i can harbor the best self i can ever hold.,Class 0
if we are talking about why am i at sfsu it because of the great kinesiology program that is offered here.,Class 0
what ai can do is only induction.,Class 0
"i was looking for something similar with phys 111, so thats why im here.",Class 0
how is the light bulb work?,Class 0
"for a first time physics student, i sure feel confident that i will be successful in this course because sci is very helpful and im really interested in the material so far.",Class 0
this course i am in is a supplementary course that is meant to give extra work in an attempt to help performance in the class.,Class 0
i feel happy being able to explore and have fun.,Class 0
i suppose i am also here because lab is a physical reminder and helps learning the core concepts that is being discussed in lecture.,Class 0
i am here because it's a required class.,Class 0
i hope to pass chemistry and to really remember the topic with the help of this sci class and those who are part of it.,Class 0
i came from china i moved to the us when i was 12.,Class 0
"why am i here, you ask?",Class 0
i'm here because i like math and i am interested in physics and learning how things work.,Class 0
i felt interesting in physics when i first drew a fbd to analyze a force system.,Class 0
"it's not entirely hard for me, i suppose, although the labs quizzes are somewhat frustrating.",Class 0
i am in college to earn my degree.,Class 0
i also find physics to be a very fascinating subject.,Class 0
"i'm here because i have to take this course with the other physic class, but more importantly, i'm trying to learn as much as i could.",Class 0
this allows me to learn faster.,Class 0
"i always tried to make a joke out of it and say 'i'm here as someone's punching bag', 'i am someone's shoulder to cry on', or 'i am here as a placeholder'.",Class 0
the thought of having ill people looking to me for guidance compelled me to keep focused on the relevant course because i feel medical treatment is satisfying form of affection and care a human can give to another.,Class 0
"additionally, it will increase my chances of getting a job in the first place.",Class 0
so thats why im here taking chem 180 which led me to take sci 180 so i can get a good grade and transfer out of sfsu.,Class 0
"i also notice that not every lab is as interesting as checking instagram, but i do want to get out something which can be used whether in the long term future or the upcoming exams for physics.",Class 0
"i got into other california state universities as well, but i was more familiar with san francisco state because i've done an art exhibition here once and i knew a bunch of people in my after school program from my middle school that i admire that went to san francisco state and i knew it was a pretty decent school.",Class 0
"to answer the question as to why i am here, it is for myself.",Class 0
"ultimately, i decided that i was interested in the content of the class and it wouldn't hurt to get the required course out of the way while familiarizing myself with physics a little more before taking the lecture class.",Class 0
"also, i have always been interested in the physics because most of the things in this universe follow the laws of physics.",Class 0
so i think that this class will provide me with the extra help that i need for me to earn an a in chem 115.,Class 0
my major is electrical engineering so this lab is going to be very helpful for me to get my initial basics down.,Class 0
"i enjoy science a lot, by learning more i feel like the world becomes both easier to understand because there are so many working parts.",Class 0
i also heard you get credit for it and its just graded on participation so it was kind of a no brainer to sign up.,Class 0
"i remember in physics part 1, i really thought i understood it but when the problem slightly deviated from the sample problem, i was stuck again.",Class 0
i am looking forward to learning many things about how things work and interact.,Class 0
however i picked astronomy over the other labs because its actually a class that im interested in.,Class 0
"to start of, i am here in this world because my mom wanted a child, specifically a daughter.",Class 0
"im not sure why it has that connotation built into my head, but its there.",Class 0
"i still have about two semesters left, it has been a different experience for me going from community college to sfsu.",Class 0
another aspect i hope to improve is the communicative aspect that is used in the sciences; to be able to attain the rich vocabulary and certainty that comes after much practice and dedication.,Class 0
i only have bits of memories from growing up.,Class 0
this course is part of the path i have to take to achieve my career goals.,Class 0
one of them is the most basic reason which is to complete my major requirement.,Class 0
whether that be through reviewing my bio journals or going over topics that were taught in class.,Class 0
i'm here so i can go higher and higher in my college career.,Class 0
i am excited to see what i learn and the labs we will work on.,Class 0
i'm also here because i've decided to stay here when i could have gone back to my homework of san diego and possibly apply for transfer somewhere closer to home.,Class 0
may be this is because i have to solved the physics problems in a bounded time limit.,Class 0
"it is also useful as it serves as a handson experience for proving what we learn in class and an introduction to proper research, a career i also plan on pursuing.",Class 0
i am specifically in this astronomy lab class because my schedule wouldnt allow for a different class that would not be on friday.,Class 0
i wold have also much rather preferred this class would have been broken up into two days juts as the lecture is.,Class 0
"i have doubts about my capabilities, however, even with my doubts and questions, i still feel that it is normal to still be going into the world not getting everything right and not knowing all the answers.",Class 0
i attended college of marin before transferring this spring.,Class 0
i think that physics is necessary to get a really wellrounded understanding of the sciences.,Class 0
i do have a bit of interest into how planets behave and general astronomy interests that sort of fall into the category of physics.,Class 0
i'm feeling happier which is good.,Class 0
"as time goes by i'm starting to develop more each day whether it's from education, social, or even in a physical aspect.",Class 0
"clear instructions of what i shouldshouldnt do, but then to be allowed to do so without micromanagement.",Class 0

we are all here for a reason.,Class 0
because major is computer engineering which means i have to take this class.,Class 0
"in general, i really find my passion for learning about new things in my classes and especially being challenged in many ways that i usually dont in my other classes.",Class 0
the only thing is physics has so much concepts and i do not know how to take in so much information in so little time but i guess it is time to start figuring that out.,Class 0
"or maybe you question your ownmotivations on why you live, wake up, eat, and work for years to the purpose of raising a family orhoarding wealth?",Class 0

i'm here because i needed a new goal and this seemed like a reasonable one.or it is what society makes me feel like is a good goal.,Class 0
to answer the question why am i here? first of anything i am here in physics because it is required in my major.,Class 0
there are a few different things that guided me into a stem field.,Class 0

well i have many reasons that explain why i am here but let me just explains the reasons that are the most significant.,Class 0
i can't really think of where else i would be.,Class 0
like i still remember as a kid i spent all my money on lego sets and rc cars and i always liked building and modifying to make it better by trial and error.,Class 0
in way like having a sort of credibility or being able to make money to then later fund my dreams.,Class 0
doing well in school helps me love myself more and more.,Class 0

i also took this class because i needed 12 units for this semester and i need to pass calculus 1 in order to get more of my major classes of engineering so that is one of the major reasons why i am here.,Class 0
i was first brought in the stem field when my mother brought me a book about the solar system and the formation of the planets and moons in the solar system.,Class 0
"but if i am being honest, i am okay with just knowing that it exists.",Class 0
however i truly do enjoy learning about physics and all its aspects and i hope to continue learning about physics and its wonders in the future.,Class 0
"this is my first time ever taking physics, which is pretty scary to me but very interesting at the same time.",Class 0
what i liked about it was that we were able to work on projects that reflected what we were learning in class.,Class 0
"however, i think understanding physics is integral in understanding biology so im glad im learning this information.",Class 0
but i'm fearing that all the workload has turned me off from my inspirations as well because i am not well adjusted to it as of now.,Class 0
at first i looked at computer engineering but i had already spent 2 years in school and didn't want to necessarily want to give myself a total of 8 years of school (and debt).,Class 0
otherwise why i am here in the school is cause this school has good opportunities in the bay area or surrounding areas with ucsf and stanford near by if i want to do any internships or go to conferences to learn about their grad programs or attend some cool activities they would host.,Class 0
"however i do enjoy taking physics labs, they are probably my second favorite lab class to take next to biology.",Class 0
i always wanted to remain in a city since i come from a city which should not make me feel different or homesick.,Class 0
civil engineering deals with the physically and naturally built environment.,Class 0
i want to take sci because ochem ii the first time was difficult to understand from the start and was a lot of information to grasp onto.,Class 0
this attempt is a little better where the instructor is not moving as fast or is she as boring.,Class 0
i am very willing to sacrifice a lot of time to contribute to something bigger.,Class 0
"the labs are going to be more focused on the concepts rather than focusing on the visuals of the experiment, and im looking forward to what is has to offer.",Class 0
and now i enjoy it quite a lot.,Class 0
i overall want to take this class to make sure that i do well in physics 111 the way that it helped me do well in my chem 115 class.,Class 0
i am here because i have class and because i have a lot of other responsibilities to attend.,Class 0
"for example, while a systems net force is not equal to zero, it occurs acceleration by the newton's 2nd law.",Class 0
i am hoping that i am able to do well and succeed in this class so i can take the second part of physics.,Class 0
or why am i in this class?,Class 0
"it scares me, but i love it.",Class 0
other than college i wouldnt know what to do.,Class 0
why am i herei am here in this sci class because i am striving for the best possible grade in the parent class i can get and i believe this sci course is critical in helping me attain this grade.,Class 0
i am still trying to find a connection between physics and biology.,Class 0
this class was a requirement in my major which is why i am here taking it.,Class 0
"i am here because for the past 17 years of my career, i've dedicated my literal blood, sweat and tears as a cook and now as a chefowner of a restaurant.",Class 0
"i will be the solution instead of problems, and this goes for me being in college, or my personal life, or any job.",Class 0
i want the people whom i care about around me to feel my gentle compassion in many different ways...,Class 0
what matters is that we still live life in a moral and ethical manner.,Class 0
"nevertheless, i am a big fan and i enjoy doing math based things.",Class 0
"thinking from an evolutionary perspective, my purpose in life is to pass off my dna and produce offspring in order to keep my family tree going.",Class 0
"after taking some physics classes, i have noticed that we can apply many of it to everyday life and use it on the daily without noticing.",Class 0
i just wish the class was longer bc if you sit in the back you are screwed.,Class 0
"overtime, i have come to enjoy the labs and look forward to them in my courses.",Class 0
i really want to be the best scientist i can be and very much use my time wisely while i am in school to achieve and to strive far in school just like everyone else.,Class 0
im hoping by the end of this course i can take what i learned and use it in my next physics course.,Class 0
the teachers are nice so that makes the experience better.,Class 0
just to name chemistry intimidates me because of past situations ive had with past teachers but thats the reason why i chose to take sci 115 so i can overcome the intimidation and to show myself that i can do it.,Class 0
i am awake now at 9:30am because i picked classes i require for my degree.,Class 0
i have been going to philz coffee shop to study for two hours on mondays just to get in as much information as well as prepare for the upcoming week by doing the self assessment quizzes.,Class 0
"i think that even though i am a biology major, knowing physics allows me to become a well rounded individual and that majorly reflects the medical field.",Class 0
"i suppose that is a major curiosity of mine, which is how objects interact.",Class 0
"i would like to learn about the calculations and how it applies to the class, and understand to do it on my own and use the material i learn and apply it to my life outside of school.",Class 0
im here because i still confuse on when to use derivatives and when to use antiderivatives.,Class 0
"lastly, as an engineering major i hope to get valuable information that can provide me with a better understanding of engineering in general in the work life and possibly even in the future if i choose to pursue a masters degree.",Class 0
"every step that i take comes with a purpose, and nevertheless, every step that i take backwards comes with a consequence.",Class 0
"in irvine, everything is the same and the people here all have similar backgrounds and viewsideologies.",Class 0
i am happy to be part of this university as well as this city.,Class 0
"meanwhile, at this class, i'm going to experiments regarding the physics hypothesis and theories alongside my groupmates.",Class 0
i then declared a major in psychology and realized that it was not really the subject for me.,Class 0
taking physics 121 and 122 is the second level of my physics requirement to complete my minor.,Class 0
i am a handson learner so this is the best learning experience for me.,Class 0
the reason why i am here is because i take any opportunity that will aid me in my future to reach my career.,Class 0
for this astronomy class i took because i find it fascinating about whats outside in space.,Class 0
taking online labs will be something that requires extra attention.,Class 0
today i am here because as a commuter i am not always able to use the campus resources to fit my schedule and since this fits my schedule i am using this class a support class that helps me summarize the materials taught in class in details.,Class 0
there are two major reasons why we are here on this earth.,Class 0
"to be quite honest, i do not know what my purpose in life is.",Class 0
i think that i am here because this is the path that god lead me down and i am very grateful.,Class 0
"i never really put that much thought to it until my high school years and that's when i really questioned everything around me, after watching movies like the matrix and other scifi movies that involve a simulation type of world it really just like opened my eyes to everything.",Class 0
i do not want to be stumped on a problem because i cannot imagine what it is supposed to look like or what it is meant to represent.,Class 0
i think the reason ive always liked science is because theres never a moment where it doesnt fascinate me.,Class 0
i am also here because i love learning and think that physics is super interesting.,Class 0
"specifically to me, my reasons for being here now have change.",Class 0
it may not be the most ideal semester of learning but it all we have right now so i have to push as hard as i can to do the best that i can.,Class 0
i don't know why i'm here to be completely honest.,Class 0
this class also allows us to concentration on the topics we did not understand in the class.,Class 0
for three years i have been struggling to find my way and my purpose in this school.,Class 0
"i love that science is an everlasting wheel of information, its a field that will always grown and expand.",Class 0
my first year of college i struggled a lot.,Class 0
"that being said, i wouldn't be here if i didn't believe that this is where i should be.",Class 0
"i was inspired by a woman who, against the norms of her era, chooses to rescue, forgive, and be generous to those in need.",Class 0
"i felt that the biology 230 sci class, that i took last semester, was extremely helpful in helping me pass the biology 230 lecture and lab class.",Class 0
that's why i am here.,Class 0
hopefully i can find a purpose but as of now im not so sure what it is.,Class 0
why im here i am here because of my career goal.,Class 0
i have always believed that my sole purpose on this earth was to help others.,Class 0
this means that i dedicate my life to learning in the sense that learning will never end.,Class 0
"from what im told, sci was an additional class student could take to, improve gpa, gain additional help, and gain extra credits.",Class 0
"i am currently in my 2nd year, and i plan to have my 120 credits achieved by the end of my 4th year, in 2022.",Class 0
"we are here to have an amazing, meaningful life that can be contributed to society.",Class 0
i am in physics to also take physics 222 to help with my knowledge for my major.,Class 0
i don't actually know how much this kind of physics that we are doing is going to help me in robotics.,Class 0
my major is biology with a concentration in physiology.,Class 0
it all started ever since i got injured playing basketball.,Class 0
"this way, i can stay motivated on my track towards my possible career choice.",Class 0
"i owe everything to her, my life, every opportunity that i've had would not exist because of her and i think i will spend my entire life trying to show her that everything she's done has been worth it and meaningful.",Class 0
i believe education is the key to those doors.,Class 0
i am here taking this si class because i'm afraid of not passing my chemistry class.,Class 0
"in fact, physics is not like math, many theories are based on casual discoveries and repeated experiments.",Class 0
the reason for me being in this class room today is to complete the first assignments on ilearn and to do the first lab assignment.,Class 0
my major is mechanical engineering.,Class 0
im in the physics 1 class and physics lab to gather a better understanding of the world around me.,Class 0
right now im majoring in biology but i havent started my major classes because i dont know if i want to switch or not so it feels like im kind of just wasting time only taking ge classes.,Class 0
i am terrified of the upcoming exams in physics; i am hoping that coming to this class will help build my confidence and help me to understand how to look at the problems and determine what factors i need to answer the question.,Class 0
"even though i have to take this class as a requirement, i have always wanted to take take a physics course.physica laws are always referred to in almost every course that i have taken.",Class 0
i do not like being here because this course does not relate to my major and i'm failing the class.,Class 0
"after the first lecture, however, i thought this class is the one that it has a lot of connections to our real life and that is helpful to understand how things work in life.",Class 0
my intentions with this class is to actually learn and pass with an a. i am very dedicated to my studies.,Class 0
"at first i was very intimidated by sf since i had grown up in the suburbs and had never really experienced living in a city, however i really enjoyed how different things were from irvine.",Class 0
i enjoy the classroom setting and having open dialogue from petiole of all types of backgrounds and upbringings.,Class 0
"although it is challenging, i know that it will help shape my mindset and help shape my individualism.",Class 0
"i also know that physics 2 is a very different breadth of study than physics 1, so i am also interested in expanding my knowledge in physics in general.",Class 0
i am also here because of my lab ge requirement course.,Class 0
so now im a bus major with a mech engr minor since i didn't want to throw away all that hard work and also because i love the subject!,Class 0
"another reason its because you get to be lab coats wear googles like real scientist, and you get to experiment with variables whereas everyone else don't.another reason because i want to be different than my family they all follow different path where they went to business and i want to be the black goat and do something more challenging or interesting to me.",Class 0
i still don't clearly understand how physics is related to biology and why i have to do the physics lab.,Class 0
sometimes it can be even be numbing to experience so much in such a short life span but we all have a purpose whether or not we want to accept it is up to us.,Class 0
just something to get things done sooner.,Class 0
"i am currently attending astronomy 115 and attending this lab will help me with the further knowledge of astronomy, i have heard form people that this class is fun.",Class 0
ive taking sci classes for math and i didnt enjoy them at all because they didnt really provide help.,Class 0
but my teacher ruined it all because he didnt wanna do any labs.,Class 0
the reason i chose astronomy and am here today is because i simply love the subject and find it fascinating.,Class 0
i think i should review the lab right after it too because i need to go at a slower pace to fully understand something.,Class 0
"i did not like physics in high school because it was really hard for me to comprehend it, but now i am actually starting to understand physics and enjoy it.",Class 0
"well, to start off, im not sure what here really is?",Class 0
"i do think practice and experience doing homework even if you fully understand the concepts is beneficial, but i don't spend my time unless forced to like a sci class.",Class 0
"furthermore, conceptual physics has always been something i enjoyed because it helps frame a sense of grounding to rest upon when thinking about my place in the universe.",Class 0
"despite being a biology major, i genuinely believe that understanding chemistry concepts will be applicable in my future research work.",Class 0
i know she'll get to meet my children and maybe even her great grandchildren.,Class 0
learning all of these ideas and concepts really shows how small we are.,Class 0
i know i am there because i am choosing to learn and pursue the career i want.,Class 0
"for example, i can have a better idea of why it is easier to hold the middle part of an object than one side of it.",Class 0
im also here to learn and better understand certain topics that are taught in class especially the math portions.,Class 0
"ever since i was a little girl, ive dreamed of becoming a veterinarian.",Class 0
i think you could interpret this so many different ways.,Class 0
the fact that we cant see these forces at work adds a bit to the mystery and excitement of this material.,Class 0
i think i am here for a variety of reasons.,Class 0
umm to be honest with you i dont how to keep this up for another 150 words.,Class 0
i am here for several reasons and those reasons can be broken down to more reasons.,Class 0
"after experiencing those years of watching her suffer, i've developed a love for the medical field and knew i wanted to be apart of changing the lives of others through medicine.",Class 0
for the past 5 years ive switched through 4 different majors until i knew what i wanted to be.,Class 0
"but the bigger picture of ""why i'm here"" is that every decision i've made and everything that has happened to me and the people around me in my life has led me to where i am.",Class 0
another thing is not leave something you can do today for tomorrow.,Class 0
my hope for the class as a whole is to go forward in life and take advantage of the information; at the very least be able to make a few cool science experiments for my children when that day eventually comes.,Class 0
"i love working one on one with people, but i also have a hard time with doing the 95 gig.",Class 0
i am here because i would like additional help in my chem 115 course.,Class 0
"i do, just going with the flow till i realize what's really going on.",Class 0
that one worker at starbucks who made your coffee this morning might have a sense for obtaining that job.,Class 0
i don't know how true that is but i thought it was interesting because if you pay attention to the things that happen around us then you can be really attuned to the things that pop up in your life and why.,Class 0
"it is still difficult for me to process all the different formulas and calculations but because i have some knowledge about it, i can understand it more clearly.if this class was not a requirement for my major, i don't think i would have taken this course.in a way though, i think that it is good thing that i am taking this course because it challenges me.",Class 0
so i did the same thing and asked the librarian for a suggestion.,Class 0
"why am i here? is quite a general question that can be taken in many directions, but i assume that it is intended for us to make our connections to this class.",Class 0
i ended up choosing bio as my major in hopes of gaining a better understanding of the world around me.,Class 0
i feel like im here to make the people i love and the people around me live their life to the fullest.,Class 0
yah i think ima do that...,Class 0
i think about this a lot.,Class 0
"as for why i'm here at sfsu, i am here because it seemed like a school with a lot of diversity and opportunities.",Class 0
i am a dualmajor at san francisco state university.,Class 0
"i have been greatly inspired by the intellect, positivity, and enthusiasm of the physics teachers i have had, so i think i might continue taking physics courses even though this course is the last physics class required for my major.",Class 0
i have never taken a sci course before since they often would overlap with my other classes.,Class 0
i also feel having a good understanding of knowledge and concepts.,Class 0
"i am taking this class because it is one of the last lower division requirements that i have to meet for my biology major to continue on to more in depth upper division courses .i am also in this class because i decided not to take physics with calculus, even though it probably would have made it easier for me if i did because i already had taken calculus a few semesters ago and got an a in it, so now i had to take general physics two without calculus because i had taken general physics one without calculus.",Class 0
"no, the second semester i did not have a realistic grip on what my responsibilities were at school, and out of school ( work, money, household chores, friends, girlfriend ) and how to put them all together.",Class 0
"i am here because i aspire to be a scientist, more specifically an anatomical pathologist that works for the center for disease control.",Class 0
"when chemistry is involved, physics is almost always involved.i guess another reason why i'm here (pertaining to sfsu) is because it's near my house.",Class 0
i hope to enjoy this lab course more than previous lab classes as they generally arent my favorite thing.,Class 0
i came here from texas in order to experience life in a different place and try something new.,Class 0
literally all the students that are enrolled are in the same boat as me.,Class 0
i feel like i am meant to be here.,Class 0
so in a sense i enjoy learning about physics because the underlying thought process shares common ground with programming.,Class 0
she seems like she actively cares about her students and wants them to succeed.,Class 0
im here for a college education in order to get a good career that i find an interest in.,Class 0
i really like that there is a space where we can come for help it means a lot.,Class 0
i dont know what im doing.,Class 0
i am here in order to advance in my calc 2 and understand what is happening.,Class 0
i wish to get good grades out of this class and maintain my gpa. through this lab i also wish to see the cool stuff that happens when we understand physics in our daily lives.,Class 0
i look forward to learning and understanding physics throughout the semester.,Class 0
i enjoy the lecture more than the lab because i understand it more.,Class 0
also why im here is because ever decision i made in my life thats led me to here.,Class 0
"although this class is only 1 unit, it helps me reach to my requirement.",Class 0
uhh the tutors are really cool and nice even though i forgot casey name p.s. im sorry casey lol.,Class 0
i thought that sci 230 would give me more insight and go in depth about topics we just blow through in lecture ( and i was right!).,Class 0
"moreover, the more deeper i get into this field, the more i understand its importance in the very existence of our society that depends on technology.",Class 0
"lastly, sci classes are graded based on class attendance and participation, so if you attend every class and do the activities, then you will get an a and earn one unit, which is a good deal.",Class 0
"finally, he succeeded in launching rockets as the president of a private company.",Class 0
"school and education plays a big role in this generation, and without education, there isnt much left out there in the real world.",Class 0
"in addition, this class is also a prerequisite for my major in computer engineering.",Class 0
"hope for the best for me, please.",Class 0
the reason i am here is to do experiments and get a better understanding of physics.,Class 0
im crossing my fingers because kinesiology is an impacted major.,Class 0
i feel that i am learning as well as teaching people compassion and understanding that everyone has their own challenges and that you cannot compare people.,Class 0
"3 hours is a very long time to remain focused on one task with no break, atleast for me.",Class 0
"beyond not knowing what physics is or not having any prior experienceknowledge about physics, i wanted to take this coarse in order to get to know more people.",Class 0
i am the first one in my family to move out of my hometown so it has been a huge accomplishment being able to do so.,Class 0
"also, statistics have shown that people with higher education and wealth tend to be healthier.",Class 0
"im basically just here to get a better grade in the class, hopefully i can pass the class.",Class 0
other then that i've actually never taken physics in my life before.,Class 0
it would be such a big help and difference for me when i do pass because i would then realize all of the hard work i have set was worth it.,Class 0
so far i would say that i like this class and look forward to the upcoming weeks.,Class 0
i wish we could go outside i really miss going outdoors with my friends and i miss traveling and i spent my 21st birthday indoors.,Class 0
"his teaching skills helped take an interest in physics, although i am a biology major.",Class 0
"i feel like science can be applied anywhere while math, english or history etc.",Class 0
it took me quite awhile to figure out what i wanted to do.,Class 0
however the hardest thing has been physically being away from campus.,Class 0
i feel that what i learn in this class will help me in the future because pt is all about analyzing the bodys movements and if there's anything that we can improve on and newtons laws and knowledge of forces will help.,Class 0
i am taking both a physics121 sci course and chemistry215 sci course.,Class 0
there's more stress than enjoyment for me.,Class 0
"phelan glenn vernon wetzell phys11206 8312020 reflective journal 1 : ""why am i here?"" after hearing so much about the struggles of physics i actively avoided having to take this class sequence.",Class 0
i do not like physics that much but im do enjoy doing experiments.,Class 0
im in the lab mostly because ive always enjoyed hands on labs.,Class 0
i signed up for this si class because this is the first physics class ive ever taken.,Class 0
currently i'm learning conversions which i am bad at.,Class 0
i definitely learned a lot in my conceptual physic class.,Class 0
i am in this astronomy class to fulfill a lower division requirement.,Class 0
but thats not me.,Class 0
another goal that i have for this class is to gain some confidence within my physics courses so that i am ready to take on my next physics class.,Class 0
engineering is a field that has interested me and i am excited to learn more about it.,Class 0
there was an expectation for me to figure out what i am doing and what i am supposed to do.,Class 0
"also, in taking this class i am preparing myself for my biomechanics class next semester.",Class 0
these changes that have impacted my life has got me wanting to share it with the people back at home.,Class 0
"due to the pressure of getting a bad grade, an overload of homework, strict rubrics we have to follow.",Class 0
there are a lot of reasons why i could be taking this class and i'm glad i'm taking it.,Class 0
this semester is the first time i am taking a biology course so it would be the perfect opportunity to decide whether i want continue my career in biology or change my major.,Class 0
but its whatever.,Class 0
i am in this physics class because i have to be.,Class 0
the reason i am at college is to better my life and to build my career.,Class 0
"other than that, i guess id rather do physics than a second semester of calculus.",Class 0
i really like physics but its difficult to understand.,Class 0
"for they felt remorse, although didnt understand that it took time for my mother to recover mentally.",Class 0
astronomy is fun because it has to do with space and i love learning about space.,Class 0
i am here in the sci class because i would like to be pushed to dedicate time for focusing on physics.,Class 0
my hopes are to come away from this class with a passing grade and with a better overall understanding of basic physics seeing as this is the first physics class i have taken in my life.,Class 0
and when i graduate from college i want my background to make a good impression to impress my employer.,Class 0
"although i'm grateful for the opportunity, i think i could flourish just as much if not more else where.",Class 0
i am here in this world to make an impact.,Class 0
the difference is: chinese high school emphasize physical theory much more than physical lab.,Class 0
"being in this class is very fun because people in this class are very nice, and it is easy to communicate with the teacher.",Class 0
"coming to sf state was not my top choice, it was actually my last.",Class 0
"after a couple weeks into the semester, i thought i would give a sci class a try.",Class 0
another reason i am here because i want to have a solid foundation for calc because i will be continuing onto higher math classes.,Class 0
"i also like labs because i am a tactile, hands on kind of person.",Class 0
"many tech companies such as ;apple, google, tesla, settle in this bayarea.",Class 0
"michael urestiastro 116why am i here honestly i'm not too sure why i'm here but there's only one thing i know and that is to make it worth it all the way through till the end, i personally dont think anyone knows why were all here but i know that everyone has a purpose, goal, desire or a dream they want to achieve in life.",Class 0
being able to do good in this class gives me the purpose to get my degree and reach my goals.,Class 0
ideally id want to do both just so i didnt have to choose but ill probably end up having to choose anyway which is stressful.,Class 0
im here to get a better understanding on cell biology and to practice what i have learned in class into more depth.,Class 0
i am in sci 111 because i have never taken a physics coarse in my life.,Class 0
aside from that i have always been fascinated by physics and understanding why things work the way they do.,Class 0
why i am in this class is because i am major in computer engineering major.,Class 0
i heard this class is different compared to phys 1.,Class 0
"and to be fair, i could use the extra boost for my gpa. my instructor quickly lists the main points of the topic and quickly moves to other topics.",Class 0
"in face, i actually having a hard time to learning other course like biology and chemistry.",Class 0
now that i'm in this class i can work with other students that are in my lecture classes and try to figure out what some vocabulary might mean or even solving equations together.,Class 0
i decided to combat climate change by lowering my carbon footprint and finding alternative solutions that wont harm the plant like switching out single use plastics for lifelong alternatives that are recyclable or biodegradable.,Class 0
"by physics we can figure out some concepts for example, after taking this class we will know how to calculate the vectors, acceleration, force, wight and sound and many other concepts?",Class 0
"assuming that, i am mainly taking this class for my major requirements.",Class 0
"another goal is to study the effects that global warming, ocean acidification, and water pollution has on the marine animals.",Class 0
i am good at science classes except for physics.,Class 0
being in a sci class makes it easy to ask questions and work with the people around me so that we have discussions about the concepts comparing to the large 100 people class.,Class 0
i also enjoy the team work an d bondi ng aspect s of lab because it is a great way to make new friends an d connections.,Class 0
knowing this the why for me is to speak my truth where i go and to love people where i am at.,Class 0
i chose to go to this school because i felt it was the best fit school for me since it was far enough away from home but at the same time still close enough to where i can go back and visit often.,Class 0
"hopefully, i can finish the course excited for the next physics course that is required for my major.",Class 0
"i started my college career as a political science major because i used to aspire to be a politician, but later decided that was not the path for me.",Class 0
i think that college is a great place to be as it is a melting pot of people and culture.,Class 0
"since i have no experience with physics whatsoever, i decided to take sci 111.",Class 0
"even though my major does not really correlate with this particular course, i still feel that expanding my knowledge in different areas of education is definitely one or the enriching ways to have a full college experience.",Class 0
science is power!,Class 0
"i am open to many different specialties and feel like as time goes on, i will find the right fit for me.",Class 0
i think the calculus is what scares me away from the subject.,Class 0
"i am excited to be learning physics in a lab setting though, hopefully it serves as a better way to conceptualize the things we are lectured about.",Class 0
i also want to add that being in this lab allows me to hone my physics comprehension which is a plus.,Class 0
i am the peace maker.,Class 0
"obviously capitalist greed infiltrates scientific inquiries the same way it appears in any other field, and im not trying to put the scientists of the world on some noble pedestal.",Class 0
"at first, i thought that i couldn't be a biology major because i thought i wasn't smart enough because i am not good at math and a lot of my classes involve math.",Class 0
"physics is also all around us, how things work, gravity, and etc.",Class 0
keep looking up my friends,Class 0
"i learned a lot of the same material in my ap biology course(mostly about cancer) and it feels like a good refresher before i go even further, considering my major is biology.",Class 0
i look forward to working with everyone in class and maybe make some friends along the way as well.,Class 0
"science is a subject i have always found interesting, but difficult.",Class 0
"i took the class in high school so i have a bit of background, but this obviously only goes so far since it was so long ago and the topics will be much more difficult here in university.",Class 0
school is essential in to days society in order to obtain a well paying and generally higher stature job.,Class 0
it makes me feel more active.,Class 0
i am here in physics lab because it is part of the requirement as a biology major here at sf state.,Class 0
"i also feel like, i would benefit from working in a group and having people next to me would really help me understand the concept because they will have a different way of explaining and doing the problem.",Class 0
i am on the cross country and track team here at state.,Class 0
these different subjects are all related which makes learning them at the same time easier and also more fun.,Class 0

the meaning of life?,Class 0
to me getting an education is really important.,Class 0
it is amazing review and reflection time on what we just learned in class.,Class 0
i want to go into a stem field because i think stem is interesting and can lead to real change.,Class 0
the reason i chose to take phys 112 was mainly because its a requirement to graduate and also because ive never taken a physics class in my whole life so i thought that itd be pretty cool if i did for my first semester of my second year of college.,Class 0
i guess im just here to fulfill my requirements for my major.,Class 0
i want to have as much fun before i die and that i am going to do everything i can to remain on that goal.,Class 0

honestly the kahoot really put me in bad spirits but also put me in hopes because now i know what i need to learn.,Class 0
"when the years came by with all these classes, i realized that i like being in this major.",Class 0
its different because i moved to a different city.,Class 0
it may be kind of indirect but it is to help them be happy.,Class 0

i will be rst generation university graduate.,Class 0
why am i here i want to talk about why i came to united state that will explain why im here.,Class 0
when i was a junior in high school i attended an occupational school for where i learned digital media.,Class 0
so this class seemed like the best way to balance that.,Class 0
the reason why im currently here at this school consists of different reasons.,Class 0
but i feel like there's so much more out there that i haven't been able to take advantage of.,Class 0
this is the reason why i am here.,Class 0

i can talk about why i am here at this current moment or why i am here on earth.,Class 0
i am here for two reasons: 1.,Class 0
"i only took one physics course in middle school and i had to make a car that would move with a balloon, but i dont remember if it actually worked or not.",Class 0
everything is convenient.,Class 0
i also like engineering because my father is civil enginner back home.,Class 0

this is my first experience having a lab dedicate to physics so i'm curious but a bit nervous at the same time.,Class 0
honestly though i think physics is really cool.,Class 0
the reason behind that is physics is very applicable and available compared to another branch of science.,Class 0
"giving the circumstances, i don't think i will be able to move up any time soon.",Class 0
"i've always loved space and cosmic objects, so when it came down to choosing a science to take, i knew i wanted to take astronomy.",Class 0
"my approach to medicine is a holistic approach which i believe is the best approach because it doesnt solely focus on prescribing medication and sending people on their ways, rather it focuses on pushing health and taking care of the person as a whole in order to ensure that i left them better then when they came to me rather than just temporarily fixing one problem while inducing another one.",Class 0
i noticed that we are all different people and we can offer different type of knowledge to each other.,Class 0
im also here because i fulfilled the prerequisites for this course by completing precalculus last semester.,Class 0
i learn better via a handson approach so taking this class has helped me a lot.,Class 0
"online learning is a sad new reality for students, at least in the united states.",Class 0
i also want to learn more about physics because the subject really interest me.,Class 0
"between stressing about classes, money for rent, and trying to looking for a job i think i'm holding on.",Class 0

so far in the first lab we underwent electromagnetism and charges.,Class 0
"the ingenuity of humans and the learning ability and speed of computers will change the world as we know it, and i want to be at the forefront.",Class 0
this class has been a great way for me to start of the semester.,Class 0
the bigger reason is that this class was one that fit well into my schedule.,Class 0
i love everything about this school and just wish it didnt have to be online.,Class 0
i find it super helpful that sfsu provides resources for students to have extra practice and aid to solidify knowledge of certain classes .,Class 0

"after a couple years of doing this, my general interest in topics began to differentiate.",Class 0
"i guess i can say that i've found my own purpose, as cheesy as that sounds.",Class 0
my parents are in la so its not that far where i can't go visit at all so i thought this was a good school where i was able to be independent but still visit my family every once in a while.,Class 0
many things we have today would have been invented without the knowledge that comes from learning physics and how it affects us.,Class 0
i want to get into research.,Class 0
"i want to learn, so i am here to get supplemental help.",Class 0
"not to mention, it can also fulfill my general education class requirements for college, then i can move on to upper division classes.",Class 0
this is really a philosophical question you're asking here.,Class 0
"we all have our personal issues outside of school that affect our performance, such as anxiety and depression for me.",Class 0
i hope to pass physics this semester but most importantly i hope to understand the concepts i am learning.,Class 0
i know biology is largely based on building one concept off of another so by taking sci 230 it will help me make sure that the foundation of everything were learning is not lost on me.,Class 0
"also, i'm interested in how the stuff works around us in our daily life.",Class 0
i don't want to hate a subject because i'm too slow of a learner.,Class 0
i did very well in physics 220 but physics in general gives me anxiety.,Class 0
honestly i don't know what i am actually doing.,Class 0
jessica e. guizar09032020why am i here?,Class 0
i find this ok but also not very effective to my understandment.,Class 0
i personally like physics myself so attending this lab is fun to me.,Class 0
why am i here?i am here because my mom did not know how to use birth control and my dad did not know how to use a condom.,Class 0

i come from an abusive family.,Class 0
i took chem 100 and i got a c. i know that i could have done better if i would have had the extra help.,Class 0
im not that interested in physics but so far from being in this class physics does not seem to be too hard but also not easy.,Class 0
"this class is a prerequisite to my major but also, i never took a physics class so i wanted to see if physics is a really interesting subject in the science field.",Class 0
"i enjoying being in class when i actually understand the material, however, when i do not understand a topic, the class becomes quite frustrating.",Class 0
"i've had to overcome a lot of adversity to make it to this point, and i am so grateful to be in a place that i spent so many years dreaming of.",Class 0
"in medical school, i will need to understand the human body and how each part works and why it works.",Class 0
"i need to be someone, not someone famous perhaps, but someone who can look into a mirror and recognise who is on the other side.",Class 0
i feel that i am ahead of the game because i know what this course holds however i will go above and beyond to finish this summer semester strong.,Class 0
it seems cool and i am glad to be a part of it.,Class 0
i was a neuroscience minor because i loved understanding how the brain works.,Class 0
i feel like the reason why im in this class has to do with the reason why im here in general.,Class 0
"this way by being in this class, i know i am taking the necessary steps to set myself up for success and not failure.",Class 0
it's a big beautiful world and universe.,Class 0
"i am also taking this course at the same time as another lab course which could be a good thing because they may go somewhat handandhand, but i am hoping the overlap does not get too confusing.",Class 0
"i am in physics 101102 to learn about physics, and how the natural world around me works.",Class 0
i'm afraid of asking for help.,Class 0

"i am in physics not only because it is required for my major, but for me to better understand how things work on the world.",Class 0
i partially describe myself as a scholar and i feel the most scholastic taking part in the scientific activities.,Class 0
"although im not taking this class voluntarily, i understand the importance of this lab. my major is computer science.",Class 0
"i am here in this class because i am a biology major with a concentration in physiology and the requirements for my major is to take this class with physics 111, and to be eligible to get my bachelors degree.",Class 0
i suppose the second reason why im here is just for the extra support im case if i need it since there are some hard classes so it wouldn't hurt to just take them.,Class 0
it is so interesting how much makes up our entire universe and how much we dont know about yet.,Class 0
"however, because phys 112 is mandatory with phys 111, here i am.",Class 0
"rosalyn prem february 24th, 2020alma journal 1question: ""why am i here?"" i am here as a biomajor because i believe that just like anyone of us in this classroom, we are all able to become scientists.",Class 0
but why am i here more specifically in school.,Class 0
i was given the chance to think freely and to create actions that can affect those around me and change things in my life.,Class 0
"at the same time, physics makes sense because i can physically see everything that we discuss like gravity and acceleration whereas in chemistry, i just have to trust that electrons actually exist and interact in the way that im told they do.",Class 0
i need help in understanding how i can improve myself to be better for a specific problem i have during lectures in chemistry 115.,Class 0
physics will help me if i ever need to make any calculations that involve movement along any of the three axes.,Class 0
that is the reason why i am in this class.,Class 0
"one of the skills to learn, i believe, is to connect with something that you already know or something that you can think of.",Class 0
i also feel that there is no such thing as learning enough so i know that there is always something new i can learn here whether its a harder problem or just going more into details with definitions of topics.,Class 0
"i have a strong image of how i want my life to turn out, and being here will help me paint my canvas.",Class 0
"i am not saying it is a wrong belief to have, this area of intelligence and it's true value are impossible to record by mankind which is saying something in itself.",Class 0
"it's either i will choose a career path in this college path, or realize i have a better path else where and pursue that instead.",Class 0
for that reason it is that i felt the need to instead take advantage of my time.,Class 0
then i began to focus on math and science from a young age.,Class 0
i am extremely grateful that i have an education because not many have this opportunity.,Class 0
"i've always wanted to help animals ever since i was a little girl, specifically dogs, because i love them so much.",Class 0

"i feel like it is kind of hard to describe the full reason as to why i want to go into stem field, because there are so many reasons.",Class 0
"i personally have never really liked physics, probably because it is more math than a lot of my of my other science courses on top of the fact that it is (in my opinion) a more abstractdifficult course.",Class 0
i am in computer science because originally i wanted to join the military but then trump got elected so i went to college and choose my major by throwing a dart at a board.,Class 0
"after the first exam, only 6 of the class passed with a grade of d or higher.",Class 0
"although i could have attended other schools, this school was more convenient.",Class 0
i feel like knowing all this information can be beneficial to the real world and my future career in medicine.,Class 0
"the majority of classes are lecture based, which involve sitting still for at least an hour to listen to theories and problems.",Class 0
the number one.,Class 0
"personally, when i decided to add this class, it was because i thought o chem 2 was difficult.",Class 0
i'm currently taking two classes and a lab for my first semester because i have a fulltime job.,Class 0
"i'm here to learn more about general physics and get a better understanding of how the complex concepts discussed in the lectures in my other class, actually function in real life.",Class 0
i also need a fooking hair cut rn.,Class 0
"it's also quite ironic because i'm in an engineering related field so it's quite funny to think about an engineer who isn't particularly good at science or math, which are the two tenets of any engineering background. thanks for listening to my ted x talk yup.i'm also here because of decisions made by my ancestors and myself to survive so far.in case you don't understand english, i've translated this into latin so you can better understand.bonum quaestio!",Class 0
"hopefully, i finish in 2 years and being here right now in this class adds up to that point.",Class 0
it was all done based off my curiosity as mentioned before.,Class 0
i am here so that i am can become confident in speaking up and sharing my thoughts in an organized structure.,Class 0
i thought i wouldnt be capable of learning this subject but i passed physics 1 and i believe if i study hard enough i can pass physics 2.,Class 0
"i have taken physics before and i did struggle, especially with word problems.",Class 0
i come to this class not as a past failure but as someone with experience and understanding of what to expect.,Class 0
we go recap on a lot of material so i can really get what i going on by all the example problems they give us and seeing why and how to work together to really understand the material rather than just knowing the information from a short class period.,Class 0
"however, similarly if you asked a dog to recite a poem in english you would come to the same conclusion it would.",Class 0
i learned how to manipulate the equations that will help me in physics.,Class 0
"for example driving a car, opening a door, and even walking.its good to understand how the little things in our life function.",Class 0
"this question got me contemplating tho, like why am i here?",Class 0
"in terms of concepts and theories from physics, i don't know much about physics.",Class 0
i also took an astronomy class last year and i enjoyed taking that class.,Class 0

"from my results last semester, i received all as which felt amazing since the rest of my college career was abysmal based on the transcripts.",Class 0
i did not want to take any chances with physics so i made the decision to receive extra help.,Class 0
"""why am i here?""i am here because this class is a necessary step in the degree and ultimately career path that i want.",Class 0
the list keeps going!,Class 0
i dont even have my passport yet.,Class 0
i am here because i choose to be the better person rather than staying at home and being a useless member of society.,Class 0
"however, it's not too bad i've always excelled in science and math, but due to my poor work ethics, the damage is evident in my past grades.",Class 0
computer science is about logic and how things work.,Class 0
being in this class i will maybe meet new people that have different kinds of majors.,Class 0
i'm also trying to see some interesting things by doing some experiments.,Class 0
it also shows academicmental flexibility as physics is not related to the profession i am pursuing.,Class 0
i have a hard time finding out which formula could be used to solve the problem and i am just really bad at math in general.,Class 0
"the tools necessary in determining why i am here can only be answered in asking who caused me to be here, then, who caused my parents to be here, and so forth and so on.",Class 0
i also get to ask any of the questions i might have about the lectures we have gone through.,Class 0
"i am not the biggest fan of labs, because i am not very good with my hands at all, but i am required to take a lab along with physics 230.",Class 0
"while i might not need to specifically known translation and transcription or anything like that for my specific career goals, it'll give me the background i need to be good at my job.",Class 0
i had zero confidence in myself to be where i am and never thought i would be in college.,Class 0
in high school i had to an option to take physics but i never taken it because i did not like math.,Class 0
"it would have probably helped me get a better grade in the lecture class to take them together, but it wasnt as bad as i thought to just take the lab which also serves as a refresher for my next semester taking physics 121 and physics 122.",Class 0
but to be honest in the back of my mind i know what it has taken me to get to this point.,Class 0
i feel like i have to have this big purpose in my life already figured out.,Class 0
i personally do not like labs which i thought was because of the length but i find that i usually go into lab very confused with the instructions and not really understanding why im recording measurements.,Class 0
"in terms of this class, i would say i needed the extra unit to complete this ge requirement and so im here in this class now.",Class 0
"i love the creativity and mathematics filled environment where i have a blast playing around with graphs, equations etc.",Class 0
"furthermore, the main reason why im taking this course is due to my major.",Class 0
"i have taken physics before during my junior year of high school, but if im being honest, it wasnt exactly the best.",Class 0
"physics applies to many aspects of life, however, so that helps somewhat in terms of having motivation to put in effort.",Class 0
i am here because i need help with subject and i dont understand how this class works.,Class 0
"it started as one of those careers that elementary school kids talk about when their teacher asks them what they want to be in the future, and my answer was always a brain surgeon, because how awesome does that sound.",Class 0

i find it necessary to be challenged in this way because it changes my perception.,Class 0
im here because i have a love for astronomy and space.,Class 0
i never viewed my situation as traumatic or permanent but merely a starting point for something valuable.,Class 0
i remember taking physics back in high school but i don't remember as much about the class.,Class 0
i am here at sfsu in order to obtain my bachelors of science degree in biology with a concentration of physiology.,Class 0
"i chose this major because i enjoy science and as much as i wish i was good at it, i suck at math.",Class 0
i am going to work very hard in this class to achieve this.,Class 0
"honestly, i have always just been connected to this city.",Class 0
i loved math growing up and that helped as a deciding factor.,Class 0
"i am here to earn the best possible grade, and to learn.",Class 0
"before chem 115 the last time i took chemistry was my sophomore year in highschool, and as a sophomore in college currently, most of the material that i had went over in highschool i had forgotten.",Class 0
"for one thing, it is a course i have to take concurrently with the lecture course.",Class 0
my aunt is someone i look up to since she is a radiologist at the stanford medical center in palo alto.,Class 0
i learn more from hands on experiences and generally more willing to learn when it comes to labs and experiences that involve actual physical involvement.,Class 0
but also because science has always been my favorite subject and so taking a physics lab interested me a lot more than other labs that were available.,Class 0
"secondly, i think there are a lot of opportunities in the main parts of the city for my career choice.",Class 0
i am also here in this class because i need to fulfill my ge requirement.,Class 0
i am here mainly to help myself with my chemistry class and to better master the material.,Class 0
but i love this class so fr and the teacher seems really nice and fun.,Class 0
"all forms of science such as chemistry, biology, and physics occur around us during our day to day lives but we seem to ignore it.",Class 0
i also want to be able to teach people what i know from coming here.,Class 0
i decided to take sci 215.,Class 0
the only thing that helped me was aleks and it has helped me understand concepts.,Class 0
"i am a stem major, but i have never taken physics before.",Class 0
i hope that learning these concepts will help me in my career later.,Class 0
"for engineering, i will definitely need to understand physics because thats mostly what this major is.",Class 0
"i dont care whether it is small or big, i would be grateful for either.",Class 0
i think this class can prepare me for the future as much as any other class.,Class 0
this is good because you can gain a sense of understanding of this class through your peers and helps you be more aware of areas that you don't understand due to group works that is provided.,Class 0
i am a double major in latinao studies and biology with a concentration in physiology.,Class 0
it was one of the best experiences i have ever had in a college coarse.,Class 0
"so only because of the lab, will i give physics a chance, i expect to learn a lot on why things work the way they do.",Class 0
i've always been fascinated by the ideas and theories that physics is responsible for and engineering combines all different formats of learning.,Class 0
i feel that astronomy can be a way for me to expand my skills in the science field.,Class 0
even then i still hope to learn more towards my degree biochemistry.,Class 0
i am also here to enhance my learning for this subject as well.,Class 0
in terms of why im here like why do i exist or why am i? i would say because of my parents choosing to have me.,Class 0
i am here at san francisco state university because i fell in love with the city when i first visited back in 2017.,Class 0
"when my time is done god will know what ive done, and see that it was beneficial to the world.",Class 0
"in order to finish reading the book, i have to take this class.",Class 0
knowing that my work will make a change.,Class 0
i also think that physics is essential to life and to know how the world works is very important in any major or path you take in life.,Class 0
as well i hope with this lab class i figure out what i would like to do in the future.,Class 0
i have heard that physics is not as hard as some of the previous science classes i have had to take for my major.,Class 0
ive noticed that this semester specifically im a lot more outgoing with talking to people.,Class 0
the main reason i want to continue going into the stem field is because i think the future of our world depends on it.,Class 0
"also, i know that i hate writing papers so i also choose a major that has the least amount of writing in it.",Class 0
it's pretty tricky.,Class 0
"i am here for a purpose, just like everyone else.",Class 0
i have been in a sci class before for chemistry 1 and it helped me almost get an a in my class.,Class 0
surely there must be some metaphysical being that allowed for nature to give rise to such a dominating force of animals.,Class 0
"i know my purpose for being here, and hopefully i fulfill it while i am.",Class 0
"with this mindset, i am here because the topics that i will learn in this class such as electrical circuits and electric current can be very useful in the real world; understanding current and flow of electricity can enable me the skills to fix various machines throughout my house.",Class 0
"i never thought i would be taking an astronomy class, but here i am, and it is extremely interesting.",Class 0
"i think that im able to understand all of the sciences pretty well, mostly i think because i have a passion for them and make a greater effort to comprehend them.",Class 0
"but at the same time, i worry about my english ability.",Class 0
"to live a life that does not solely benefit me, but rather to put another before myself in all situations.",Class 0
plus the fact that i am trying to graduate before the age of 30 while most of these kids will probably graduate at 2122 sometimes gets the best of me.,Class 0
i have astronomy lecture 15 min before this lab so it's really helpful to have these back to back so that it is easier to not forget information and to ask follow up questions i still has from the lecture.,Class 0
"however, i believe that i have the idea of how the class operates, so im sure ill be fine and pass the class.",Class 0
it doesn't matter what the hell you do.,Class 0
i didnt want another lecture like class and some of those lecture classes conflicted with my schedule.,Class 0
currently i am in the physics 222 class to develop a greater understanding of physics.,Class 0
my mother finally snapped and decided that everything is for nothing.,Class 0
i wanted to join the stem field because i have always been very obsessed with mathematics and science from a younger age than most.,Class 0
i signed up for science 115 to get extra help for chemistry 115 class.,Class 0
being able to get a visual representation on the topics that we talk about makes for a better learning experience.,Class 0
"since i was young, i have always had a passion for cars.",Class 0
"this question can have an honest and straightforward answer, which is because this class is a requirement for my degree. therefore, i must complete and pass this class because i need it to receive my diploma.",Class 0
"dear zhuowa wu,i am here because i am an environmental science major; as such i should be well equip with basic physics amongst other basic sciences such as chemistry.",Class 0
i am here in this class because it is a required for my degree.,Class 0
"not only that, but also because this is a required course for my major, but i do enjoy physics.",Class 0
my main reason for signing up was to spend extra time reviewing as i knew i would have trouble procrastinating this semester wich i am trying to avoid.,Class 0
advances in tech and software will lead to a world where people can live easily without much waste.,Class 0
"furthermore, my interest in physics is lacking due to my major.",Class 0
all i ever want to do is smoke a joint and play video games.,Class 0
"it is amazing to learn how there are other planets, galaxies, and so many starts outside in outer space.",Class 0
i chose to take astronomy and astronomy lab because it interested be the most out of all the other science classes offered for my ge requirement.,Class 0
last semester i was a chemistry la and even i was sh locked when the instructor asked me to be an la for her class because before her chemistry class i thought chemistry was my worse enemy.,Class 0
"my determination to graduate on time, applying to veterinary school, and found love for science has me driven to taking these types of classes.",Class 0
they continued to support my dreams and passions no matter the circumstance.,Class 0
there 1.4 billion people there in china.,Class 0
"angelina nguyenandrew sturnerphysics 112june 24, 2020reflective journaling 1i never actually took a liking to physics because i always found it to be quite difficult to understand and i had trouble grasping some concepts.",Class 0
i can learn art on my own time and learn the fun part of game design later but computer science is a skill that i lack so i need to challenge myself so i can not take an easy root and get better in life.,Class 0
you can take that in many different directions.,Class 0
my main goal is to learn.,Class 0
and theres about zero chance im getting that this semester.,Class 0
it seemed like the responsible decision to make.,Class 0
"since i have never taken any kind of physics class, the topic does kind of scare me, and knowing that its based on algebra, trigonometry, and geometry does make me nervous.",Class 0
i am going into the stem field to try and address problems that are facing the world today.,Class 0
i decided mine to simply be to experience life.,Class 0
simply this course is a major requirement.,Class 0
when i decided to drop the lecture class i had to weigh the reasoning behind staying in this class vs.,Class 0
the way i interpret the question is either as a philosophical question or asking why i am actually in the class.,Class 0
i also have to take physics 2 next semester so i would like to have a firm understanding of the basic concepts before they get even more complicated.,Class 0
but the homework on aleks also isnt very helpful for me because it feels like i'm trying to punch through a brick wall without knowing there are tools better suited for the job.,Class 0
"i am computer science major so it may not be directly related, but the scientific process and experiments as well as the thought process can be transferred universally with all other science fields.",Class 0
5 minutes of reflective journaling should result in an essay of about 150200 words.,Class 0
"john henry skinner phys 11209 r 9320i think this one is actually pretty straightforward for me, because it's centered around a call i've already had to make.",Class 0
i mean i dont really know why i am here.,Class 0
i try to spend more time studying for physics compared to my other classes.,Class 0
i is a hard goal to achieve but hopefully my passion can drive me to my destination.,Class 0
i took the prerequisites class last year in order to join this class.,Class 0
"the standard i set for myself is very low, but i hope to change that.",Class 0
i've had a pretty bad physics class experience because i couldn't fully understand what the teachers are trying to teach.,Class 0
now with that out of the way i will talk about why i am literally here right now.,Class 0
"other times im so grateful to have made a big step and change attending sfsu, i've changed so much and so has my perspective slowly but surely developing with such rich information i have obtained since arriving here.",Class 0
that is why i am at san francisco state.,Class 0
this is the main reason im here; because it is a requirement in order for me to acquire my bachelors degree.,Class 0
the field seemed perfect to me.,Class 0
to have a better understanding of this i am glad im given the opportunity to learn more about astronomy.,Class 0
and to have a job where i get to see animals all day and make them feel better from whatever ills them would make me so happy.,Class 0
i hope to do well in this class and i plan on putting a lot of effort in achieving a good grade.,Class 0
and i belong to the school of thought that you shouldn't dwell on these things too hard if you want to avoid an existential crisis.,Class 0
i took physics in high school and i learned a lot then and i just want to keep learning and get a better inside of the subject itself.,Class 0
it can have many different contexts that it can be used in.,Class 0
"i do like the fact that i was able to be a zoology major, but i don't feel like i've gotten the full college experience.",Class 0
ive been taking the class for a bio major but i dont seem to be more passionate about the major.,Class 0
physics can be interesting depending on the student and the teacher.,Class 0
i dont have a strong background in mathematics or problem solving skills yet every time i enter a new class filled with people who are over confident and think they can ace thee class without trying.,Class 0
if something i can make or contribute my efforts to can make that happen that would be satisfying to me.,Class 0
although physics is a mixture of science and math i think it'll come in handy for the future.,Class 0
"sf state has a great kinesiology department for me to take classes for my career, even though it is severely impacted.",Class 0
it really fascinates me how you can actually use math to figure out how objects behave and why they behave like that.,Class 0
i am taking physic classes because i am majoring in biology in physiology as a focus.,Class 0
"one one hand, leaving to such a far distance from home to attend university is not what i first expected.",Class 0
i an here at sfsu for 2 reasons.,Class 0
i initially entered college with a business major.,Class 0
the tools and knowledge used in this course only align with a very specific subset of the entirety of my career path.,Class 0
i am currently taking this physics 111112 class because it is a requirement for my major.,Class 0
ive had good times and bad times with science over audrey my school years back in middle school i had to my opinion one of the best physics teachers and he started a sparking me that started liking science but after that the other teachers i had just made me dislike science overall and not show up to class.,Class 0
"if the question is for the purpose of getting me to question my existence, then it worked.",Class 0
"one could say i am here now because i have not done the requirements needed before freshman year, namely precalculus.",Class 0
"because their purpose is no longer there, they have been there for a long time, and they no longer have a purpose.",Class 0
"i am here because despite all the order that needs to be in place for our universe and the things in it to be in relative equilibrium, i am a product of the spontaneity of our universe.",Class 0
sometimes i am not ready for things and rush into them.,Class 0
"as for why am i in the astronomy lab, it is because i have always been curious about astronomy and wanted to know what it feels like to learn and be taught about it and visit the planetarium.being here feels nice as there are people to interact and share stories with, there are places to connect to and there are memories made and moments lived.",Class 0
the only thing i can think of is maybe it assists in nutrient cycling?,Class 0
"i originally wanted to move to la or san diego, san diego state was originally my first choice.",Class 0
i did not actually allow myself to really try to understand the materials before giving up.,Class 0
"overall, i am excited to learn some new things in this class and i will work hard to make sure that i understand what is being taught.",Class 0
im not a huge fan of physics largely because it been a subject that has been extremely difficult for me.,Class 0
i am a visual learner and for me bio 230 is not a long enough class to accomplish the kind of learning i need.,Class 0
"you need all four of those things to understand how life works on earth and i have taken classes on all those subjects, except for physics, so i felt i was missing parts of my understanding of the world.",Class 0
apparently my schedule that i have does not meet the hours they are open so its difficult to get materials .,Class 0
"i am excited to see what this virtual lab will bring, even though i know it will be a little more challenging to get the same experience as face to face classes.",Class 0
"i originally wanted to study zoology and become a zoologist, but my confidence and passion for the goal has diminished over the years.",Class 0
"that's as far as i know at time of writing, at least.",Class 0
"its my first sci class so im still trying to see how this is structured and how i can make it work for me, because the sci is designed to help me, but as im doing physics, im realizing that theres lots of different ways of seeing and understanding the concepts.",Class 0
a question that can only be answered within your inner self.,Class 0
i am in physics 23206 specifically because it is the best time for me to have this lab.,Class 0
earlier in life i couldn't decide what i wanted to major in but recently computer majors have expanded beyond computer science which was the catch all of the computer degree.,Class 0
i am here in the east bay because it is where i was born and raised my whole life.,Class 0
"i hope to take in as much information i can from this class, and bring it into the real world when i finally leave.",Class 0
i never understood the concepts behind phyiscs and now that im in this class its becoming more and more clear.,Class 0
"there is no reason or rhyme to why each of us are here, but it is our duty to discover what that means for us, individually.",Class 0
though this class is a requirement for my major zoology i have a strong passion for questioning the world as we know it.,Class 0
im hoping to work and interact with my group and develop my skill more.,Class 0
i dont want to fail again and i also would like to understand it.,Class 0
i'm taking this class in order to complete my course requirments.,Class 0
"i took some time off school, and decided to come back the next semester (now) because school was always really important to jordan, and i have been really focused on not letting him down.",Class 0
"but when i moved to sf, i met so many new people and was able to gain new perspectives on life, school, and other things as well.",Class 0
im here because i want a better future.,Class 0
i think that theyre really important to know and how stuff works.,Class 0
understanding the concepts helps with comparing it to real life situations.,Class 0
there are a couple of reasons why i want to go into the stem field.,Class 0
but i am glad that i like physics so that i am able to enjoy the class while i learn.,Class 0
5 minutes to talk about why i think i am here..,Class 0
one more reason is that am not too much into leterature or medical fields.,Class 0

if we are talking about this specific class i am here primarily as a prereq for biomechanics.,Class 0
"i was never the ""straight a"" student that people percieve me to be....",Class 0
i am here to learn more about the topic that we see in class but are generally less tangible to let me and others better understand how the processes work in real life or to just experience them.,Class 0
i also think i would not be here at this school to even be taking this class in the rst place.,Class 0
you can see the way peoples face lights up when they see someone who looks like them and speaks their language.,Class 0
i discussed the different pathways with my parents.,Class 0
"i grew tired of working long hours, hurting my body and serving people.",Class 0
"i literally use math for anything like calculating how much time i have to get ready and do my make up, how long it's going to take to get to school, to make food.",Class 0
people around the clock trying to decide what aspects of their lives involve only needs or wants.,Class 0
"i thought to myself, what would the harm be in taking a si course?",Class 0

going to a class which helps me study and manage my time.,Class 0
i start thinking of other ways in which it will be easier for me to understand concepts and not just solving or getting the right answer.,Class 0
this is a prerequisite for other upper division classes that i must take to complete my coursework at sfsu.,Class 0
"so far in my tough journey i have a little bit of slack on me, so i have to pace myself and pick it up so i can overcome my obstacles and get through this and please my mum and make her proud.",Class 0
i can also correlate that with the calculus thati've been taking.,Class 0

"however, my opinions and views have drastically changes since starting classes at san francisco state university.",Class 0
"for example, so far we have been looking at unit conversions, rates of change, dimensional consistencies, and such and i am sure that this will help me in classes such as in the sciences and math that i will have to take in the future.",Class 0
to have knowledge about the way things work and relate to each other is a powerful skill.,Class 0
i think the reason that i am here is to complete my physics classes.,Class 0
im taking this physics course because it is a prerequisite for medical school.,Class 0
this is phys 222 so the labs are not that much complicated as higher level courses.,Class 0
it is difficult but i enjoy problem solving so i enjoy stem topics.,Class 0
which just gives us the ability to calculate the velocity or acceleration of the thrown object at a given time but i do not necessarily know how to arrive at the equation if we were to actually perform the experiment in real life.,Class 0
i especially love life sciences and marine biology.,Class 0

this physics course is a requirement for me in order to achieve my degree.,Class 0
i would probably start to relate everything i see with the concepts and formulas i have learned and started to explain to my friends.,Class 0
this is my first physics class i've taken since freshman year of high school and i didn't do so good in that class because i thought i wouldn't do anything with sciences or math so why bother learning this.,Class 0
i think this question can be answered in many ways.,Class 0
physics is not my favorite subject because it involves a lot of math that i do not enjoy doing.,Class 0
i think it is about being able to think critically.,Class 0

"everyone made their mistakes and their successes in life, so i try not to think too much about either one of those.",Class 0
"honestly, i think i'm here by some sort of luck.",Class 0
i wanted to take physics 111 because i took physics in high school and i'm more familiar with these concepts then say chemistry or biology.,Class 0
i also want to know what are the different objects we are able to see only through telescopes and not with our own eyes.,Class 0
with school life it really hasn't been fare to me.,Class 0
this allow me to focus on what i really need to study for the exam.,Class 0
i had never been to the library nor had i ever been able to pick something that i wanted to read.,Class 0
i am here in physics to learn how physics applies to my major of physiology.,Class 0
"there are many opportunities that await, and branches will keep expanding from what stem can do.",Class 0

so i am here to represent and to make my family proud.,Class 0
"although this class is a general education requirement the moon, stars, and space have always piqued my curiosity despite my lack of knowledge of the subject.",Class 0
the reason why im taking this tutoring course for calculus 2 is because i felt as though my foundation for calculus 1 may not be as strong as i need it do be.,Class 0
this school is also pretty good to transfers and accepts your application without too much hassle.,Class 0
but why am i in this class?,Class 0
you may ask why i was born in a house?,Class 0
i come here to learn more about concepts that physics has in general.,Class 0
the amount of genuine joy and fulfillment i get from existing in the same time period as some of my amazing friends and family really is what drives me in life and i think thats why i am here.,Class 0
i have friends and family in china but why am i here.,Class 0
so the extra help will give me motivation and confidence while doing assignments at home.,Class 0
i feel that everyone has a purpose on this earth and my reason here is to have a name for myself.,Class 0
"the professor may not always have time to cover everything in detail during class time, so sci 321 is a good opportunity for me to ask more in depth questions and think critically about the material.",Class 0
it consists of knowing what physics is and applying it to the real world and knowing what all equations mean.,Class 0
i'm looking forward to the rest of this semester!,Class 0
"i assume that rates of change, what we are looking at right now, can probably be very helpful for me to understand the field i am studying.",Class 0
i feel that the physics and chem attracts me.,Class 0

i strongly believe that we are all here for a reason and finding your purpose is what life is.,Class 0
i am at sfsu because i wanted to run cross country in college.,Class 0
it is a very much needed course for my major.,Class 0
i strive to be knowledgeable and wellrounded so any opportunity to expand that is greatly appreciated.,Class 0
"during my sophomore year here at sfsu, i was just as confused as when i came in and decided to declare business because everyone around me said it would be a good idea because you can do a lot with it.",Class 0
"i guess since then, i've forgotten how intriguing this whole field of study was and the reason i keep coming to this lab is because it's fun and interesting, though i wish i wasn't as long as it is; i realize though why that is.",Class 0
thats why i am here.,Class 0
chris seng reflective journal 1 i am here because as a stem major i need a certain amount of units from the calculus and physics section in order to graduate.,Class 0
this class is a requirement to helping me move forward in my career path.,Class 0
some topics of physics will help me through life because in life there is physics.,Class 0
why am i here in stem?,Class 0
"im here to learn what ive been trying to avoid learning, but enjoy it so far.",Class 0
"i took physics in high school, but i can't recall much of it so me being here will give me a better understanding of how physics works.",Class 0
first to create a meaningful and wonderful personal life that can be shared with another human.,Class 0
"therefor, this revisit of the course allows me to step back and learn the topic better in time for the mcat where i will need these skills.",Class 0
"i am a computer science major which involves a lot of math, and phys 220 is the first science class that is required to be taken and it comes with a lab as well.",Class 0
"as to why i'm in this specific section, it is simply because it fits the best with my schedule.",Class 0
"i dont believe i have any higher purpose and that im only here because of chance and the odds being in my favor. if by here, however, you mean to ask why im in this class, its because i have to be.",Class 0
i think everyone was a little lost in my class.,Class 0
i dont know if this question ponders why we are alive today in this world or why we are in this class.,Class 0
"back then, i only learned about the conceptual physics and i often gave up when i encountered a word problem that was too hard.",Class 0
"in the lecture, there is no homework or quizzes so that is a major part of the grade that is not going to be added because it is just based on the exams.",Class 0
i intend to finish this physics class and continue on to the second semester physics to complete my requirements and move on to upper division courses within my major.,Class 0
"and the idea of being free, and doing anything that i want is the main purpose of me being here.",Class 0
what is my purpose?,Class 0
im grateful to be going to such a good university with such caring professors.,Class 0
"physics is interesting as many of the concepts are conceptual and people who are younger wouldnt really think much about how it works, but once you learn about things like energy and gravity, it opens up so much knowledge and things to discover.",Class 0
only a few years ago almost everyone had begun carrying a smartphone with them.,Class 0
"one, i have always been a techy!",Class 0
"overall, im here to focus on my future and have a positive influence on society.",Class 0
i am taking sci 234 to improve my skills in physics 230.,Class 0
"like understand velocity, acceleration and displacement to determine the motion of an object.",Class 0
one is obviously this class is a requirement for my general education credits and also because i thought it'd be interesting to further my education on astronomy.,Class 0
"i am going to die anyways, the only thing that moves most humans forward is the small things.",Class 0
"i also had a year selling electronics parts (transistors, resistors those kinda things) at a local electronics store in costa mesa.",Class 0
"but since there must be a purpose to needing to know physics in the eyes of the biology department, i will try my best to at least get a grasp of knowing what is going on.",Class 0
"perhaps another reason is, it's important to know physics, so that we'd understand how things theoretically work.",Class 0
"although i am not a physics major, i do take joy in telling others what i am learning in class.",Class 0
"these two things are always exist in our life, but we are ignoring them every time they show up.",Class 0
i am mainly here once a week trying to learn something new but mainly finish my general requirement.,Class 0
i'm a firstgeneration university student so i'm mostly just grateful for the opportunity to study and see the world through so many different lenses.,Class 0
"i entered college with extreme certainty that this is what i wanted to do and fortunately for me, this feeling has only been solidified.",Class 0
maybe i actually don't fully understand the concepts?,Class 0
"even though i lack motivation at the moment, i still would like to be a cardiothoracic surgeon someday but i feel like it is not my purpose.",Class 0
so then i thought i could take textiles lab and that it would count for my ge requirements.,Class 0
i am nervous about taking a physics courses because i have never taken one before.,Class 0
"why i am herefor graduated, we need one science lab class.",Class 0
this is why i am here.,Class 0
i want the additional help so that i can better grasp the concepts being taught in lecture.,Class 0
"yes, i will have to document my work, but i won't have to propose theories and preform experiments to determine the validity of my theories.",Class 0
"even if i was not into computer science, my major would still be somewhere in the stem field, because i was always more interested in math and science than english and history.",Class 0
i am attending this class to fulfill the prerequisites needed for my major.,Class 0
peer learning is an effective way to expose the complicated concepts.,Class 0
"and, the best place to know and explore physical science thing is this lab.",Class 0
i had a pretty bad experience in the astronomy lecture in the fall of 2018.,Class 0
it takes a lot of effort for me to study and work for this class because i have a short attention span with things im not fully interested in.,Class 0
"financially thought, sfsu was what i could afford so i committed here.",Class 0
its pretty interesting to understand the way things work.,Class 0
why are you here?,Class 0
this course is one of the prerequisite courses that i need to complete before taking any upper division science courses.,Class 0
i know i have years ahead of me but this is a dream i will never stop chasing.,Class 0
i spent my first two years of college getting prepped to go to nursing school and i had a realization i did not want to do that.,Class 0
"as well as, vectors and their importance to the world of physics.",Class 0
"for many of us here phys 111 is a required class for many biology majors, but i'm particularly interested in getting introduced to new topic.",Class 0
hopefully finishing the course will allow me to be more open in science courses and be excited to learn some new things.,Class 0
there are times i feel like an imposter in my classes.,Class 0
my only hope is that i'll be able to pass this class and graduate smoothly.,Class 0
"therefore the ability to be able to leave this class with a deeper understanding of the natural environment and my interactions with it are of the utmost importance to me, which is ultimately why i enrolled in sci 180.",Class 0
leaving home and venturing out to attend college at san francisco state became something i wanted do once i was presented with how this route can lead me to success.,Class 0
i have taken physics in high school and i am hoping it would be similar because it was fairly easy and fun.,Class 0
i am enrolled here because it is apart of my pathway of life to lead me to my goals.,Class 0
"yet there is a limit to being curious, as one should not go deeper to something dangerous.",Class 0
i find it pretentious to think about it and self congratulatory and those who do view themselves better than others.,Class 0
"im classroom setting, i cant help but feel invited to learn especially with individuals that are equally eager.",Class 0
it amazes me on the stuffs in it as there's still many things that amaze me still.,Class 0
"however, i don't really have a choice so i will just have to manage like everyone else.",Class 0
"for this physics lab, i am taking this course to fulfill part of my lower general education requirements for my major, kinesiology, and for more units.",Class 0
especially since i will be using physics in my everyday life it would be pretty important to me to learn it early and fully understand it rather than struggling in the future and trying to understand it while im at a job wouldnt really look too well on me.,Class 0
i see it as an opportunity to learn by doing experiments.,Class 0
"my intended major is civil engineering, i've been striving to be that since after high school, in which i went to a four year university.",Class 0
these are the main reason i am here.,Class 0
the stem field is very important because stem is by my side.,Class 0
"in other words it seems life is just the test, and whatever is after life is the bigger picture.",Class 0
"in addition, i find physics to be very interesting as it affects us in our every day life.",Class 0
"its also hard to keep up with my lab partners because they have prior knowledge of taking the course before but, ive committed to putting in the extra effort to understand more about the labs by reading the summaries and reviewing them after to see what ive learned.",Class 0
i didn't really think about the future.,Class 0
i also hope that attending this course will broaden my conceptual comprehension of physics.,Class 0
i joined sci 111 because i was in sci 230 and 240 and it did help me while i was both in biol 230 and 240.,Class 0
there was a group of students in my chemistry 115 class inviting us to join a tutoring class that will give extra help for chemistry.,Class 0
i am here because this class is required for my degree.,Class 0
everywhere we look in the world we are surrounded by physics so it is important to understand.,Class 0
"i know there is no perfect answer for it, we just have live this life to know why we are her and to what purpose we serve.",Class 0
"in bio 240 i didnt had a great time because we learned about animals and insects and plants which is dry labs and are boring, so i hope this class is fun.",Class 0
"i am here for, i'm not exactly sure anymore.",Class 0
"as i got older and figured out what i wanted to study and do my life, i grew an interest for all science courses but especially physics since it's an everyday thing.",Class 0
and i am also here typing this on my computer from home right now because of covid19.,Class 0
overall i see my education as a gateway to help others in need.,Class 0
"the way i interpret it as is, why am i here in the world today.",Class 0
"to do so, i want as much exposure to the concepts as possible.",Class 0
education is important to me.,Class 0
"so for example this class, phys 230 232.",Class 0
i took physics when i was in my freshman year of high school which was almost five years ago.,Class 0
i would rather ensure i succeed in all my courses this semester so that i can graduate and get out fast.,Class 0
my whole life i wanted to work with animals but as i grew up i realized that that isnt something ill be able to pursue because i have a weak stomach.,Class 0
i recently transferred here after taking a break for two years due to a traumatic event.,Class 0
everything is a process and learning process.,Class 0
i was not able to attend the first lab session earlier in the semester which was the reason why i never got to submit this.,Class 0
but on my own reason is that i cant survive in china society.,Class 0
i still remember my experiences not taking sci when i was completing my bio 230 and 240 pathway and when i took sci for chem 115.,Class 0
to make myself a better person and more knowledgeable,Class 0
i am a rather spiritual person i would say and i am also a curious one and for that reason i've asked a lot of different people a lot of different questions.,Class 0
"like most of my fellow classmate, we are all unfortunately forced to be contained in our homes instead of a normal learning environment.",Class 0
"it is one thing to take physics but it is another to understand it, to know the material and how to apply it to the real world.",Class 0
so i took this challenge and decided on studying mechanical engineering because i felt it is the only major i am interested in and feel is worth my time (pay off eventually).,Class 0
i prefer labs more than lectures since i am able to move around and not be forced to sit still while some person talks at me.,Class 0
even though im a biology major science is still very difficult for me.,Class 0
"even though it terrifies me, i am still willing to learn physics.",Class 0
"when i was younger, my sister introduced astrology to me, and i thought that astronomy was the exact same thing.",Class 0
"but luckily botany doesnt really need math, cell research also doesnt need that much math as well.",Class 0
"science can be applied to so many aspects of our lives, especially physics.",Class 0
many things you see live in stem. i want to enter stem because the income of the stem profession is higher than in other normal professions.,Class 0
this course actually excites me because it is not about the human body or random chemicals (i hate chemistry) it is material that i can compare and contrast to my every day life.,Class 0
"however, because of our current situation right now having to take classes online, and having an asynchronous class, my struggles in physics is back.",Class 0
"i still couldnt help but take a music related class every semester, whether it be an electronic music class, chord theory, or live performance bands.",Class 0
i want to open my own practice in san francisco and to make people feel good about themselves.,Class 0
why are we all here?,Class 0
"however, that doesn't change the interest i have for physics.",Class 0
"sci 230 is meant to help me achieve these goals and if i didn't take this supplemental course and i ended up finishing the semester with less than an a, i'll never forgive myself for not taking advantages of the opportunities provided for me.",Class 0
"i am still dreading the difficulty of my upcoming classes, but i am ready for the challenge and hope to come out on the other side much smarter and ready to apply this knowledge for good.",Class 0
i am required to take this class and many more other classes that also require labs.,Class 0
"i took the class last semester and completely stumbled and failed because i didn't understand any of the concepts in the beginning, and gave up for the rest of the semester.",Class 0
i want to obtain this degree to then attend a medical school and declare my field of specialty in paininternal medicine.,Class 0
i love math and every subject that has math.,Class 0
i cant sit in a class with more then 200 people and just raise my hand because i feel like id be the only one confused about what im asking while everyone gets it.,Class 0
when i chose this major out of interest i didnt look into how challenging it is.,Class 0
i went to bootcamp and then the next year started back at college in a cs program.,Class 0
when we moved from guatemala to the united states all she wanted was for us to have a better future.,Class 0
i can practice on writing lab reports and improve it.,Class 0
i also came to sfsu because of the apparel design major and am really loving it and learning so much in this major.,Class 0
"if i had the choice, i wouldnt be taking it given physics 2 is likely to be a net loss for my gpa given anything less than a straight a would be.",Class 0
i always struggle with physics concepts so when this course was offered i was more than happy to sign up.,Class 0
"i am here because i commute to school everyday from antioch, ca to further my education.",Class 0
"i took the lecture last semester and i did just fine in that class, although it sucked that i had to finish that class online.",Class 0
"it was hard for me to tell which constellation i was seeing in the sky, so i hope to get more practice using the night sky tool in future labs.",Class 0
so that is what i am doing here.,Class 0
later on anything with technology drove my interest.,Class 0
helping others get motivated to learn satisfies me so much and it builds new friendships that have a strong base.,Class 0
i didnt want to put myself through a course where the professor made physics (an already difficult subject) even more difficult.,Class 0
i would want a job that has meaning and would benefit the world.,Class 0
"i often ask myself this question, ""why am i here?"" and i start to think about all i have done to be here, how far i have come.",Class 0
"i am here because as humans, we learned to be more present and to have direction in our lives.",Class 0
i try to take a sci class every semester because i have trouble focusing and understanding the professor since it is more fast paced and the class is big so its hard to have that one on one.,Class 0
words i never thought i'd hear.,Class 0
i was impressed by this story.,Class 0
i also hope this class best prepares me for the mcat. this class will help me understand physics and will help me in my future classes.,Class 0
"i know that this different field of science will give another perspective of how i will see the world, the universe, and how everything works from force to gravity to energy and beyond.",Class 0
this class is also important to be able to have the opportunity to get hands on with the material taught in the physics 121 lecture portion of the course.,Class 0
i have carried these values with me through school.,Class 0
"a one hour airplane trip back home, 7 hour drive.",Class 0
i can also use this time to do the work i feel is more difficult.,Class 0
"i am here, i guess to start initially with san francisco state because i had a change of plans in my major.",Class 0
i would say these majors are considering ones of the hardest majors in universities.,Class 0
"also, turns out im not good at analyzing people so i dont know what people are thinking or read the room well.",Class 0
i think the reason goes beyond me though.,Class 0
"so far, i'm having fun and learning a lot.",Class 0
the surrounding is comfortable.,Class 0
"i always think to myself all of the things that have happened to me since i moved to san francisco last year, good or bad, and all the new things i learned and how there was no way i would have done that back in san diego.",Class 0
"to put it simply, she could not teac h if her life depended on it.",Class 0
learning about that and being able to help another person life is success and providing for the community around.,Class 0
maybe that is why many people in jail end up committing suicide?,Class 0
so i guess im here for a grade is all.,Class 0
my name is student name.,Class 0
afterwards ill use my skills and knowledge to find a career that works more for me or that i enjoy more that still can support my financial needs.,Class 0
i am here because i am trying to set out of the same routine of working 12 hours to sit by.,Class 0
"every other field of study that i show interest in is laughable in the eyes of everyone i know, and i kind of feel like i'm stuck in science whether i like it or not.",Class 0
you are able to find a common knowledge that is attainable because physicist in the past have studied this phenomenon for centuries and this course teaches a curriculum of that subject matter.,Class 0
"currently, three of my classes are related to calculus and vectors and derivatives so practicing clac, in general, will help me in my physics class as well as my statics class.",Class 0
it also allows us to experiment and understand our own trial and error.,Class 0
"im happy that i get a chance to learn things in a new way, and that goes for all the courses im taking this semester.",Class 0
scientists are always inventing new things and physics are able to help us to realize what things are done.,Class 0
i will also seek help from my peers as they may know more about certain topics than i do and try to spend as much time as possible learning from them.,Class 0
"which if i know myself well enough, it will allow me procrastinate less on the weekends over homework and study time for midterms.",Class 0
this sci class will be the perfect opportunity for me to take advantage of that learning style.,Class 0
math is also the easiest subject for me to understand since i practiced math problems a lot as a kid so i had an advantage over the other subjects im not as good as.,Class 0
and taking care of environments and animals takes care of us because we are all affected by the animals and the affected environment.,Class 0
im here to bring others ease.,Class 0
i am here in physics 112 lab because it is a requirement for my major for microbiology.,Class 0
"even though i am a secondyear political science major here in sfsu, learning about astronomy for a barea requirement has been very intriguing for me.",Class 0
i also heard good things about the sci classes from people who took it last year and they said it really helped them understand physics more.,Class 0
"i'm a biology major, and ill be taking the class that follows this one.",Class 0
then i changed it to psychology because i wanted to take the easy route because i saw that one of my friends was also a psych major so i wanted to copy them.,Class 0
i am here because i need lab credits and i have always been fascinated by astronomy.,Class 0
"maybe that is why i am here, to at least provide a slight change to science, although it may not be a big one at least it is something i can contribute to the world.",Class 0
i am here because i am motivated to try and be successful.,Class 0
the reason that i decided to join the sci supplement course was to try to get a better understanding of the organic course and make sure that i am able to leave with knowledge.,Class 0
"it hurts my head and eyes, not only that it is much harder to do online learning because i feel like i am pretty much teaching myself everything, as opposed to actually learning.",Class 0
"also, another reason im here is because i didnt take this class last semester which i was supposed to take it last semester, but i didnt.",Class 0
"i doubted if that was what i truly wanted, but after interning in an operating room over the summer in high school, my passion was solidified.",Class 0
i believe i will be sent home for a month and then deployed again.,Class 0
"as most know right now, the environment is pretty fucked.",Class 0
i believe working in smaller groups and being able to actually give an opinion helps greatly as well only because theres not a bunch of people judging if you are wrong.,Class 0
focusing on problems with a small amount of people feels more productive to me personally.,Class 0
i think it is because i have a knack for problem solving and find science extremely interesting.,Class 0
i wished i could have enrolled in prof.,Class 0
"also, it takes care of the lab requirement for credit.",Class 0
"i also want to test the waters so to say, with taking these courses and what they consist of.",Class 0
"i believe that making connections, understanding one another and expanding our views is important.",Class 0
"by doing it that way, i may be able to better understand the lecture or lab course because they relate to each and discuss similar concepts.",Class 0
"and partially, i'm not sure why i'm here.",Class 0
"so when i decide or feel that i am good at something i tend to cling to it; so this is me, clinging to something i feel i am good at, thus far at the least.",Class 0
i think that i'm here to contribute to the lives of others for the general good.,Class 0
but overall i have always been interested in the theory of quantum physics so hopefully one day i will be able to do field research to get a better grasp of how our universe works.,Class 0
"recently, however, my motivation has been up and down, and i was ultimately thinking of switching majors.",Class 0
i wanted to choose a school that was close to home.,Class 0
i am in this class because i also chose to be in the class.,Class 0
but maybe the reason why i am here is because i have a purpose.,Class 0
im trying to go it alone.,Class 0
"however, now i realized the importance of enrolling into the classes a little earlier.",Class 0
my major is astrophysics and the reason i chose that major is because astronomy is only offered as a minor so astrophysics was the closest major to that.,Class 0
"despite it being required, i am also here to learn just like for any of my other courses, whether they are required ge's or required for my major.",Class 0
with physics i can explain why a ball drops when you let go or why it doesnt move if you do not touch it.,Class 0
its essentially a larger study group that we have more handson review on what we are learning.,Class 0
"maura concoran, my chem 100 professor, made the subject much easier through her explanations and through attending office hours.",Class 0
the reason as to why i am here is simply because i needed help understanding some aspects of chemistry.,Class 0
"i am in college because i like learning, and want a good job that pays enough where i don't have to work crazy hours at a job i absolutely hate just to stay alive.",Class 0
"because i believe the other people who want to be teachers are often deferred from doing so, because of the low salary.",Class 0
so i am here by choice.,Class 0
"my instructors have great teaching methods like kahoot, warm ups, worksheets, etc. that help me remember and practice the material.",Class 0
i want to stay in my community help educate those who are not as knowledgeable so that they make informed decisions.,Class 0
"first, i did physics 220 which seemed a little easier in comparison to physics 230.",Class 0
they take care of premature and critically ill babies.,Class 0
i need more tools and resources to succeed in organic chemistry.,Class 0
many people now have a stem education and careers.,Class 0
i am here for a whole bunch of reasons.,Class 0
"also, the biology lab class is helping to improve my lab skills.",Class 0
"in high school, we were not offered a physics class.",Class 0
will there be any handon project or all these all labs?,Class 0
still waiting for the response.,Class 0
i saw that this could bring the opportunity a balanced worklife in and out of the field.,Class 0
it also gives me the chance to have the handson experience and apply and improve my knowledge and connect the dots between what i learned from lectures and what i learned from labs.,Class 0
"anyways, ive always liked chemistry and i enjoy studying for it but its always a class that you need to put in the work to get good grades.",Class 0
"lubat asadovafebruary 21, 2020reflective journal 1 i enrolled in sci 220 for multiple reasons.",Class 0
"science has always intrigued me, but i feel like the schooling system of stem classes kind of makes it harder for me to enjoy.",Class 0
i plan on continuing by going to dental school and becoming a dentist.,Class 0
i am grateful that physics is required because it allows me to have a deeper understanding of how the everyday experiences works.,Class 0
if i show up to my classes there is a greater likelihood where i pass my classes if i show up.,Class 0
i don't really like thinking about that question but i'm happy and i love the people in my life right now.,Class 0
"but, why am i here?",Class 0
"if it is a general question, id say im here to learn more about the things i am curious about.",Class 0
i sometimes wonder if ill live here forever or if i will move somewhere else.,Class 0
i know for this class all this information even though i have a hard time grasping the information will help me succeed in the future.,Class 0
"i'm pretty confident in my skills in chemistry currently, but i hope that by the end of the semester i will gain more confidence and not be afraid to ask questions and make errors.",Class 0
all of the choices ive made is bringing me to a higher purpose that i know is waiting for me at the end.,Class 0
my motivation lies in this city as for i dont think i could ever not live here.,Class 0
one thing that routed me to that career field was being involved with sports my whole life up until high school.,Class 0
i think im here because im suppose to make a impact no matter how big or small on the people i come to interact with.,Class 0
no other science caught my attention as much as astronomy has.,Class 0
so far the school has been good to me other than the fact that all of my first exams fall on the same week.,Class 0
i then started building plastic model kits and eventually began to work on real cars.,Class 0
"so i went into college with wanting to be a astrophysicist but i was also really interested in actually making devices and not all just theory and teaching, i decided to switch my major to mechanical engineering and really enjoyed it, so i never looked back again.",Class 0
why am i here in this sci 111 course?,Class 0
it seems that the professors are planning to make us the new einstein.,Class 0
"i dont know where my life and passion for learning will take me, but it is exciting.",Class 0
"however, the reality is that the field of physics is quite versatile because its a mixture of using our knowledgecommon sense with new information to solve a question.",Class 0
i am also here because i heard you were a great teacher from some of my friends.,Class 0
"i also like the fact that i can ask the sci instructors questions about chem 115 material, questions regarding calculations, alex homework, and upcoming exam material.",Class 0
i took physics during the summer and i learned a lot in the little bit of time i had.,Class 0
"this course also serves as a study session for me which forces me, in a way, to actually learn in a structured environment rather than on my own.",Class 0
i am simply there to have more guidance and practice on the material taught to me in my chemistry class.,Class 0
a vast majority of what we plan to study in this class has nothing to do with my reason for being here in general.,Class 0
through lectures so far and in the lab i have covered a lot of material i did not know of.,Class 0
"in terms of sf state, or studying cinema here at sf state, i would say im here because i have a passion for film and i want a college education to help me in my future aspirations.",Class 0
"when i am in that room, i feel comfortable to ask my questions without having anyone judge me because i did not understand a topic that was taught by my professor.",Class 0
being a chemistry major isnt the easiest thing when i have to take calculus based physics on the side.,Class 0
"physic has always been the one subject i find so interesting and yet i have always been avoiding taking in, since it was not a needed course for my previous major.",Class 0
"in college, i find joy in taking new biology courses and learning new things that i didnt know before.",Class 0
i am not very good at physics it has never been my strong suit and the idea that i have simply made it this far demonstrate to me that i can do this.,Class 0
"to have that degree i need to learn physics, and use it once i have learned it.",Class 0
growing up i wanted to be in the stem field.,Class 0
i also took astronomy 115 last semester and received a decent grade on it so i thought this class wouldn't be too bad.,Class 0
"i think about the way i want to be here, for instance to spread happiness and love.",Class 0
the reason why i am here is to learn the fundamentals and ethnics of physics and apply what i learned in the future for any possible reason that requires the knowledge of physics.,Class 0
but as it turned out it was one of the best things to happen to me.,Class 0
i hope i would like a lot from this class.,Class 0
"the same could be said for everyone else who has contributed to me, whether it was for my emotional health well being, physical health, a good laugh, time that was specifically for me, food, etc.",Class 0
i know that everything i learn will make me more round and capable to be more prepared for what's ahead.,Class 0
"i believe that this physics course drastically contributes to my knowledge of physics, which i will apply in my engineering career.",Class 0
"in cell biology, i look forward to learning about cellular and molecular mechanisms and apply my knowledge in the laboratory, participating in research opportunities to cement myself as a formidable force in science.",Class 0
i am in the course to get more help with understanding the concept and formulas of physics because the first class was very confusing and my professor teaches very fast.,Class 0
i learned that change is adaptable,Class 0
"however, that does not mean that i do not want an a. last semester, i recall doing an essay like this.",Class 0
this semester i am excited to challenge myself especially because this is the first time i am ever learning anything about physics.,Class 0
i'm enrolled in the chem 215 sci course for several reasons.,Class 0
why am i here...,Class 0

"for this class, i am trying to make friendsconnection with people who are trying to follow the same path.",Class 0
"i did take astr 115 during my first semester of college last year, and having the opportunity to take a laboratory course designed for it is something that i find very unique and interesting.",Class 0
that mars is made out of?,Class 0
i would want that for myself as well.,Class 0
"i also feel compelled to diversify the field of science with more women, since it is predominantly men.",Class 0
i don't really know how in depth i supposed to go.,Class 0
"so far i love the idea of california, the idea that people are open and accepting here.",Class 0
so i am in your course to learn more about physics and i need this course for my major biochemistry.,Class 0
so i decided to make my own clothesline but the design of my backyard didn't allow me for a simple line nail to the wall.,Class 0
i dont even know what my passion is.,Class 0
it is my first semester in my major as a third year.,Class 0
"even if i'm taking this class just because of my major, i'd say i'm here because i am interested in physics and what i'll get out of it.",Class 0
"another reason i like physics relates to the reason why i decided to do physics can better relate to a quote i once heard; to truly understand beauty is to be able to understand how the smallest part like neutrons, electrons, and even the quantum world works.",Class 0
i'm here because i'm fighting my hardest at every step and its never enough so now i'm doing even more.,Class 0
"she got her degree from university of california, berkeley.",Class 0
finding your purpose is just as important as breathing.,Class 0
"hello, this is rim hussein alazzani.",Class 0
i tried to ask my advisor if i can get excuse from this course.,Class 0
"for example, how can the ball move from point a to point b in how many time, or the experiment i did in high school that was we threw a water balloon from ceiling to the floor and could see the radius.",Class 0
only for the purpose that some the information would stay more relevant in my head rather than only in the beginning of the week.,Class 0
we dont really focus on that though.,Class 0
i am in this class because it was part of the prerequisite and concurrent enrollment in physic 111.,Class 0
growing up was pretty hard and the root of the problems are started from the lack of money.,Class 0
"i gained my residency in california, allowing me to go to college.",Class 0

i've thought a lot about this subject to the point where i know too many different possibilities that it can drown me.,Class 0
ive enjoyed all of my sci courses and all in all just college too.,Class 0
a degree will allow you to chose from a multitude of pathways rather than just being presented with like 2 or 3 options.,Class 0
i'm here because i should be able to relate the material being taught in lecture to understand how it applies to the real world as lab should do.,Class 0
my intelligence is always questioned anywhere i go or any class i'm in so it's hard to stay motivated or drive to succeed because you feel like you're not enough.,Class 0

i really want to be a nurse in my future and i was to show the goodness in my heart to others and show them that i am there to help them.,Class 0
i am excited to study what makes the physical world work and cant wait for this class to shed some insight into how the physical world around me.,Class 0
i am not planning on majoring in physic or go into more details physic ideas.,Class 0
i guess im just here to try and set myself up for success and live a relatively comfortable life.,Class 0
"one of the greatest scientists, einstein, says, the most important thing is not to stop questioning. as he mentioned, physics give us a tool to have questions for everything.",Class 0

i am here because i am working hard to make something of myself.,Class 0
having that full enrollment status is important to me because i need the full financial support.,Class 0
when i first started college however i struggled a lot and eventually dropped out.,Class 0
"especially when clearing up confusions and things that were not understood in lecture, i believe sci is where that can happen and those skills can be enhanced with that additional hour and a half devoted to group study.",Class 0
"even in school, i tried to be involved with stem related activities because it had always interested me.",Class 0
"when taking bio courses, i heard that it could be hard to not only retain the information but be able to fully grasp the concept of the material due to the fact that so much new information is given to you in short amounts of time.",Class 0
natalie aguirre astro 11602 why am i here why am i here?,Class 0

one being i love many topics.,Class 0
why do i need a dentistry school?,Class 0
these resources give students many options to excel in their school work.,Class 0

"also, we have to take one lab course and i choose astronomy 116 thinking it will be easy if i will take astro 115 and 116 simultaneously.",Class 0
i like the physical part of science and math.,Class 0
i am here because i am an astronomy major and physics is a pretty big part of that.,Class 0
why am i here?the reason i am here is to prove myself and the people who have doubted my capabilities all from the start.,Class 0
i really enjoy this because i am a freshmen and have yet to adapt to the school.,Class 0
"in order to pass one, you need a little knowledge from all the other courses from stem.",Class 0
"i never took a physics lab class separately so this will be a new experience for me, but i did do labs in my physics class in high school which were fun.",Class 0
another thing is that if i didnt come tonight i would not have received my participation credit for today and gotten a lower grade in the class that could have been avoided.,Class 0
i am here because i put wants over needs.,Class 0
"another reason would be that i can see how my lab partners work on the assignment, and that in turn motivates me to work harder than them to get it done as fast as i can while still following the requirements of the experiment.",Class 0
i would say that i am definitely lucky enough to be in a university where students like us get an opportunity to conduct the experiments.,Class 0
"in addition, this will be very beneficial to me because i would gain better study habits, get better review sheets, and more practice worksheets.",Class 0
"i took conceptual physics on a whim for one of my ge requirements, and while it wasn't the best class i did enjoy how straightforward it was.",Class 0
ive taken previous sci courses and they have helped me with understanding topics that are complex.,Class 0
the stem field is usually challenging and i love to challenge my self when it comes to learning new things.,Class 0
i believe calculus will enrich my life in so many ways.,Class 0
"maybe it isphilosophical, trying to make you wonder why humanity exists?",Class 0
ive wasted a lot of time here and the influences ive encountered have made my life more complicated.,Class 0
"i can see myself working in a chemistry lab but i can't see myself trying to write a book (i do like to make my own stories, however, i unfortunately have difficulty on how to write well).",Class 0
fall is my favorite season and i adore all of the activities that come along with it.,Class 0
the reason why i joined the calculus sci course is because i struggle in math.,Class 0
i am fascinated by the job and i want a career i can look back on and feel proud of my achievements.,Class 0
i often answer this question by thinking of the past.,Class 0
why am i specifically in this astronomy lab?,Class 0
i would also really like to make a difference in the world so that i can leave a mark (hopefully a good one) for once im gone.,Class 0
i'm here because i'm struggling and am desperately grasping for any hand hold to slow my fall from grace.,Class 0
but as far as san francisco state thats a whole different beast.,Class 0
i have always loved science so my initial connection to this was i wanted to work in a lab.,Class 0
we all have many purposes that we must accomplish throughout our life time.,Class 0
i should really start saving these and turning resubmitting them because i basically have the same response each time.,Class 0
i am planning on going into the medical field so i know physics will benefit me in the future.,Class 0
i am here because i'm a computer science major.,Class 0
"for starters, i am here because i believe that receiving some type of education whether its good or bad can be used for the future.",Class 0
i really hope this class continues to help me prepare for a physics tests as physics has so many problems and many formulas attached to it.,Class 0
"the answer is simple, i am here in my room doing school work because of the ongoing pandemic.",Class 0
"however, i think taking them at the same time will allow the material of the course to stay fresh in my mind so i can apply it later.",Class 0
"i'm here not only because it's a requirement, but a bit because small things have gotten in my way in my previous three years of college that have prevented me from taking it sooner.",Class 0
i failed twice because i have bad depression and ptsd. taking this class and passing it is a goal for me so i prove to myself that i can get better.,Class 0
"this year i am taking classes that go towards my actual major which is exciting, but its very challenging now.",Class 0
i never knew about the constellation called ophiuchus before taking astronomy 116.,Class 0
i originally enrolled in physics 222 since i was enrolled in physics 221.,Class 0
"however, i soon discovered that finance is just not my type, so i changed my major to computer science.",Class 0
in order to fulfill those steps i have chosen my major as biology and i am following the classes requirements that will get me to that degree!,Class 0
"i realized i dont have enough time this semester to do an internship because i need to work a lot this semester, and im trying to get my cumulative gpa up past a 3.0 so i can get into a grad school program.",Class 0
this class is one the required prerequisites for my major and any biology concentration i would want to pursue.,Class 0
i am in this class because i am taking astronomy 115 and this lab coincides with that class.,Class 0
i also find math an easier topic for me than english so that probably has an impact on my decision to do this as well.,Class 0
physics is an interesting topic and i do enjoy it but im primary here given its a required for my major of comp sci.,Class 0
"the stem field certainly is challenging and i dislike how challenging it is, but getting through will prove that i am prepared for the future.",Class 0
i am looking forward to learning more of physics so i can understand the world in a different perspective,Class 0
i have not taken a physics class before and i think this will be a great opportunity to learn more about it.,Class 0
sebastian johnson phys 112.03 912020 why am i here?,Class 0
"sorry, the reason for the late assignment is because i added the class, and originally wrote the answer on paper, since i didn't have access to ilearn.",Class 0
i hope calculus will support my learning in this course in any shape or form.,Class 0
i hate math which makes it even harder for me to love and learn physics.,Class 0
"since i have not taken chemistry in over three years, having sci course will hopefully keep my grade up for chemistry 2.",Class 0
i think that physics is a very visual science that requires labs in order to be understood.,Class 0
my dad wouldn't let go of the cheap backpacks they gave us with the school logo on it.,Class 0
i only hope that this class will continue to help me with chem this semester and maybe give me something i havent learned in the past.,Class 0
"i chose to take a path that would teach me about the stars, the moon, and what lever else is above us.",Class 0
"coming from a lowincome family, having no financial support, and growing on my own were some things i had to face.",Class 0
"i feel that way because i'm a little behind on my studies and thats do to the fact that i used to commute from gilroy to sf, but this year i recently moved to sf but now its more challenging for me because my preferred method of instruction is in person instead of virtual and now i have t o be able to get used to be in class while being at home.",Class 0
"not specifically just to learn physics, but to better my understanding of the world around me.",Class 0
hopefully things get back to normal soon because i miss the inperson class environment.,Class 0
"i strive to live this life everyday, although i am not perfect.",Class 0
these are classes that i need for my major and i do not want to retake them again.,Class 0
my first physics class was here at sfsu and it was an eye opener.,Class 0
i think that i can learn a lot and i do like learning things that a person does not think about on a normal basis.,Class 0
also i don't want to take lecture then lab a different semester and not be able to remember everything that i learned.,Class 0
"at first, i took chemistry because it was required for my major, but my feeling towards this course changed because chem 115 was fun.",Class 0
"although it is harder to do that in the time that we live in, there are still ways to prove this to be true.",Class 0
why i'm here is a pretty broad question but can also be answered with the domino effect of my personal choices (and non personal ones).,Class 0
"i don't think she might have known it at the time when she had me, but i've been the most consistently there for her as long as i could be, i think that's why i'm here to make sure that she has everything that she needs and so she always has someone on her side.",Class 0
"i also plan on taking other physics courses in the future, so it is important for me to understand this course well.",Class 0
"though i love to write fiction, the fact that it is not the most stable option does not elude me.",Class 0
i am at san francisco state university because it is a very diverse school and i like the environment here.,Class 0
"so, here i am now, taking this physics lab.",Class 0
i think i am here because i was born.,Class 0
"although i'm admittedly exhausted, and the pandemic does chip away at my motivation sometimes, i have a lot of goals and things that i want to accomplish, and this class just so happens to be along the way of the goals that i want to reach!its a little difficult to find more things to write about since im tired, but i hope that things (classes, grades, health, family) go smoothly and that this semester turns out to be alright despite the numerous variables that are bound to go against us at some point.",Class 0
in continuing my education i am preparing myself to pursue my career and have a good future.,Class 0
i just wanted a space where i could ask questions when im lost and be surrounded by people who are taking the same class as me.,Class 0
why i'm here is a good question but a very vague one.,Class 0
it helps me understand the world around me on a daily basis so i make even more informed decisions even if it is in the tiniest of details.,Class 0
overall i am bad with anything that has an equation in it and needs to be solved.,Class 0
one of these goals is being in a career i enjoy.,Class 0
"i think there is a reason why i won out of the others because i survived and won, which i guess you could say made me more superior than my other siblings.",Class 0
it would be best that i know how to write it in an organized way that makes it easy to understand the patients status.,Class 0
"because the size of the class, i dont feel as embarrassed to ask questions.",Class 0
my laziness and procrastination is what caused me to be here.,Class 0
"id like to say i'm pretty good at biology, chemistry, and math but when i come to physics i'm completely lost and almost have no interest.",Class 0
"although joining the class wasn't something i chose for myself, at least for the rest of the semester i'm choosing for myself that i will a's the course.",Class 0
"i chose to take this class because i remember physics being fun, especially during highschool.",Class 0
i enjoy the process of breaking down problems to a point that they can be solved.,Class 0
maybe the idea of being a surgeon is what i like the most.,Class 0
"i did not take physics until early on in college, and a lot of what i learned helped make sense of what i learned over the past few years in biology and chemistry.",Class 0
i'm here because i basically just want to do something with my life although right now at the moment i'm not so sure what i want yet.,Class 0
another reason i am here is because i want to be able to help others by learning something myself.,Class 0
i have a pretty tight group of friends at home that i live with.,Class 0
i feel really blessed to be here because its a city where i have developed myself as an adult.,Class 0
i have taken physics before and it is one of the few classes that is challenging because of the many different ways problems can be solve and the different explanations there is.,Class 0
"with sfsu i'm able to live at home and save a lot of money that way, even though it does affect my mental health to be honest.",Class 0
"i enjoy physics and the applications of physics, but if i had my own choice or another avenue to go down i do not think school would be that route.",Class 0
i am looking forward to this semester eventhough i know it will be a lot of work.,Class 0
"one of the reason i chose this degree is because it allows me to segue into a number of other career fields, and i find comfort in knowing i have that option available to me.",Class 0
"i believe the opening question from one of the main characters from the show is you ever wonder why were here? well, i sometimes like to wonder why im here, but usually stop to accept the fact that i am here now.",Class 0
"microbiology covers all of the cls class requirements, and physics is a requirement for the microbiology degree.",Class 0
the reason that i am taking general physics is that i need the class as a prerequirement for medical school.,Class 0
"to be honest, i don't know why i am here.",Class 0
i think i'm here because of destiny and it is my job to figure out if my fate is here.,Class 0
hopefully in physics lab we get to learn more indepth about it and learn other interesting topics in physics besides the basics.,Class 0
"last semester, i took a sci class and it definitely helped me get an a in a class that i thought i would struggle in.",Class 0
i became extremely fascinated in the sizes of these planets and what they were made of.,Class 0
"and if the result is matching the equation, i not only would feel happy, but also rewarding.",Class 0
"i have never taken a physics course before, but i have always been pretty good at math.",Class 0
"i put a ton of work into the semester and achieved all a's, but during this period i had less of a social life.",Class 0
"i want to make a difference in this world and if i can touch just one person in this lifetime, then i will be satisfied.",Class 0
i am here because i wish to pursue my education and learn more about computer technology and engineering.,Class 0
"i have always been a very curious person, from breaking stuff just to see what is inside anything to disassemble and assemble things.",Class 0
i am confident that by studying and working with the sci class that i may feel more confident in the topic.,Class 0
"i find physics to be really interesting, and important to understand what is happening in the physical world.",Class 0
"overall, i know that physics is a major requirement for a reason.",Class 0
i am here because i am in need of extra supplementation for cell bio.,Class 0
i don't regret any of those decisions since i'm doing the best that i can while trying to make the most out of the experience of being up here in an engineering program.,Class 0
"i love the excitement, the knowledge, and the help i would put towards others as a nurse.",Class 0
i have never taken physics in my life until now.,Class 0
"in terms of my presence, i believe that god has a time and place for myself here in this school, earth, and where i am in life.",Class 0
i could not let that sacrifice be for nothing.,Class 0
it is one of the three main classes that are prerequisites for other classes.,Class 0
"i intend to reach my goal no matter what, but first i need to finish all of my prerequisites in order to get to my cinema classes.",Class 0
after struggling in an accounting class i felt that i wanted to major in a science.,Class 0
"now that i am thinking about it, a lot of factors lead me to be exactly right here in this moment in lab at 9:30 on a tuesday.",Class 0
this is what learning should be.,Class 0
im a biology major.,Class 0
"the logic and the tediousness is no longer weird or annoying, it is necessary and helpful.",Class 0
i am here because this course is required for my major of mechanical engineering because it will teach me critical information that will later serve as a foundation for more advanced courses.,Class 0
i have transferred from fiji and have been in the us since 2015.,Class 0
one is take up the major leading to my dreamkinesiology.,Class 0
my major is computer science and part of my major requirements is to take physics and this physics lab.,Class 0
i'm excited to learn about physics and finally gain the understanding that i should've gained in high school.,Class 0
but in this modern era of overpopulation and different sexualities doesn't mean that you have to bear children.,Class 0
i think that kind of answer is the best outcome any wants.,Class 0
she told me all about it and how it was so interesting to her.,Class 0
hopefully this course helps me more in the class and doesnt confuse me.,Class 0
i've always believed that anything is possible if applied correctly.,Class 0
the reason why im here is because i need to take this class in order for me to continue with my other requirements for my major.,Class 0
this is the reason i chose to be a computer science major.,Class 0
"i think learning and understanding how the world works is important; we all have some innate desire to know the origins of our existence, and physics is a means to that end.",Class 0
"it was not until, i started college that i realized my passion for biology, and decided to major in biology.",Class 0
the second reason would be my goal to achieve my degree in biology.,Class 0
i took sci bio 230 like 2 semesters ago and it was literally great.,Class 0
people only fear things because they don't understand it.,Class 0
"therefore i can apply those experience to physics and engineering courses, thus make the transition from real life to classwork to be less than a hassle.",Class 0
i dont know where i see myself in 5 years.,Class 0
"furthermore, i always had a dream to be an astronaut to see with my own eyes how earth really looks like and how is it like in space, even though i know it is not so easy to become one.",Class 0
in all honesty i am not really a big fan of physics.,Class 0
"for a deeper answer, i chose to major in computer science because i enjoy problemsolving.",Class 0
there are a lot of concepts in physics that interest me a lot like how atoms behave and how charges work.,Class 0
that is why i am here in college at san francisco state university.,Class 0
i would like to dedicate my time and effort to the best of my ability to broaden my knowledge of physics.,Class 0
this is why i am here at this school and in this class.,Class 0
now that i have math done it is the only subject that i am worried about not being able to understand.,Class 0
"i would like to learn how to manage my time better, so that i have sufficient time to complete my lab.",Class 0
"i think it's fascinating how a plane takes off and lands, feeling the force on my chest, and the sweat in my palms scares me.",Class 0
i am here because i care about my grades and about the effort i put in.,Class 0
the learning curve has been quite impacted with the political covid19.,Class 0
"as an environmental studies major, taking a physics course is not in my core classes nor is it an elective for my major.",Class 0
i feel like why am i here is a very straightforward question to so many people but it can mean so many things.,Class 0
i love learning and sharing my knowledge with my friends and family.,Class 0
i think being her stands as a reminder that i would like to integrate myself into something bigger than me.,Class 0
i am aiming to earn an a in this class and move on to the next classes knowing physics.,Class 0
i understand how to do math but setting up the problem was always a challenge for me.,Class 0
this lab will help us get to know physics little better as we will not only read about it but will do experiments first hand.,Class 0
i cant take any other courses for my major until i take ochem so im in a weird state of relaxation.,Class 0
"although, i do believe that everyone has their own purpose and that life has a way of leading you to where you need to be.",Class 0
she has guided me throughout my life in wanting me to be successful.,Class 0
"when i first read this question, i thought it was asking about why im here in the world.",Class 0
i dont think i have exactly figured out what my purpose is but im working on finding it.,Class 0
but i think my purpose in life is just to exist and live the best life that i possibly can without the burden of needing to do something great.,Class 0
whats cool about taking this class here is that we have a planetarium and telescope on the roof of the science building.,Class 0
a lot of chemistry is involved in how molecules move around and operate.,Class 0
if i do not do this then i will not be in upper division standing which will then prevent me from entering into my major.,Class 0
i am really bad at chemistry and physics though.,Class 0
my mind is always blown when im learning new topics regarding the subject.,Class 0
"im here for motivation and what i mean is when i dont know how to start or complete a problem, sometimes ill just end up giving up because i had no help.",Class 0
"the second reason i am here is i actually enjoy doing math, but i am not sure about physics.",Class 0
turns out i'm not as interested and my last lab teacher did not make the class interesting nor was he helpful when i was struggling to understand certain things.,Class 0
"plus stem is also in a majority of the jobs we see today, and many of the high paying jobs are in this field.",Class 0
getting to where i am now at san fransisco state university with my current major and with my current goals definitely was not an easy journey.,Class 0
"in the past, when i took precalculus, i went to tutoring at least three hours a week and that is the only reason why i passed the class with an a. i think it is important to force myself into situations where i need to focus and work on the subject i am not good at even if that means i am more exhausted by the end of the day.",Class 0
i guess my purpose in life is to live my best life.,Class 0
i think that i am here because of a number of bumps that i have overcome.,Class 0
the biology sci 230 class was the first sci class i ever took.,Class 0
"but regardless of this, i know that every class i ever take in my lifetime will be for the betterment of it, and my view of it.",Class 0
i am here because it is one of my premajor requirements.,Class 0
there needs to be more positivity in life and i feel like if i can even try to make that impact on others around me then im fulfilling my life purpose.,Class 0
coupled with the fact that i didn't fully understand concepts i ended up failing like every single quiz.,Class 0
i feel like this system is very slow for students to understand the material as opposed to handson experiences like this lab class.,Class 0
i chose this specific time because i just wanted to get this class done as early as possible so i can have the rest of the day to do whatever i want to do.,Class 0
"after multiple students had walked in most of my stem classes, i thought why not give it a try and add it to my schedule?",Class 0
so far this class has been surprisingly fun and i actually learned a lot that helps me with the class.,Class 0
and also to see that i am not alone in my confusion over some of the things we are learning.,Class 0
what is my identity?,Class 0
i would like to apply how can i find places and how can i find bigger deepper or brights stars from this class.,Class 0
i am a senior.,Class 0
me being here is actually quite a surprise to me.,Class 0
"well, i would say its mainly because this is a prerequisite for my classes.",Class 0
also on top of learning college is a place that you can network and make connections to people from different places to broaden your point of view socially and in some ways politically.,Class 0
it seems pretty simple so far but i am taking a lot of classes.this class seems fun so far experimenting with stuff.,Class 0
i also learn how to collaborate more with my peers and ask more questions.,Class 0
"i'm here not mainly because i have to be, but moreover because i want to.",Class 0
"that is the reason why i am at this school, then i am going to talk about why i am in this class.",Class 0
i feel like they just do math all the time which is what i do as well while i'm going about my life.,Class 0
i took ap biology and i did really well.,Class 0
"but it has been a long time since i have last taken that class, so i think that my physics foundation is not as strong.",Class 0
so that's why i in this class.,Class 0
my dad is 70 and he's still doing hard labor to earn a living.,Class 0
the beginning of my childhood was spent in the philippines and it was not until i came to california and more specifically once i reached college that i realized i was given all the tools necessary to succeed.,Class 0
i prefer learning how things work than just memorizing a bunch of facts.,Class 0
i think the subject is interesting and understand some basics concepts.,Class 0
i am excited for this physics class and thats because in high school i took a physics class.,Class 0
"anyways, the path im referring to is basically the roadmap of the career im currently interested in, which is being a physician in emergency medicine; in other words, im unsure if i should pursue this career due to financial reasons and time.",Class 0
i think that being in this lab class will be helpful because we work in groups for the most part.,Class 0
"i love to learn about the planets, stars, and the whole outerspace.",Class 0
i also like that every individual here is different and i get to know a little bit about their background.,Class 0
i found sci 230 to be super helpful in my studying and getting me to really grasp concepts.,Class 0
i was very unhappy with what i was pursuing and became very unmotivated; this led to me dropping out of school.,Class 0
"knowing what formulas to use, and to know when it is the appropriate time to use it.",Class 0
my knowledge on the subject of calculus other than the basics is kind of abysmal and my knowledge when it comes to electricity and magnetism is pretty bad.,Class 0
"i hope the further along i go, the easier it will be to complete the labs and gain an understanding.",Class 0
"the human body, specifically our bones, joints, and tendons all move in different directions and provide different amounts of force that can be acted upon.",Class 0
"for example, i've always wanted to do an experiment testing out how different objects have more or less friction.",Class 0
"i know that sounds cliche, but it is true.",Class 0
i wanted to study space and it's mystery characteristics.,Class 0
"i still believe it is so, all these formulas, conversions, and isolation thinking, makes it very hard for me to determine.",Class 0
its like a domino effect if i mess up on one class.,Class 0
but sometimes i just feel like changing my major because of many reasons.,Class 0
"first off, i am at this university so i can get a proper education.",Class 0
luckily i got added to this lab just before the last day that i was allowed to get into a lab to stay in class.,Class 0
i am taking this class because i want to get the extra help and support while trying to learn new concepts in calculus 2.,Class 0
to be precise i am taking this class because it's a prerequisite for my course.,Class 0
"for the other reason, i am interested to learn physics.",Class 0
"it gives me a confidence boost within myself to explore more, and try to make more friends.",Class 0
but thats asking a lot homestly but most of us as college students work and its difficult to go around it sometimes.,Class 0
"so i entered the course wanting the help needed to understand all the content being taught in lecture in a more dumbed down and simpler setting, and to force myself to study the content.",Class 0
i am here in physics because it is a requirement for my major.,Class 0
i am taking physics at a time where my educational maturity is at a certain point where i am ready to take on this class and also know that i have the capacity to do my best.,Class 0
the main reason i'm here is because i found the lecture don't provide much support in solving exercises due to the broad amount of material from each chapter.i've been advised during the orientation to take this support to help me improve my understanding of the class content.,Class 0
i cant see myself as anything and im just stuck or im actually just not sure where im going or if im going down the right path.,Class 0
it seems to have employment opportunity in the future which definitely sounds safe.,Class 0
"home is where i feel appreciated, comfortable, and proud to be at.",Class 0
"right now, i am really stuck on vectors and calculating vectors.",Class 0
"so the reason why i am here in this class is to fully understand how physics work without having to worry about very large equations, but only the bare minimum to understand how physics worked in real life in many simpler terms.",Class 0
i just know that i like science and math and i enjoy learnig different subjects and different perspectives of theses subject.,Class 0
"in this case, it was helpful to learn about conduction and induction last lab, because it helped give me a better idea of how things work, instead of just having to think about it.",Class 0
and thats only one of the many aspects of stem that makes me want to pursue it.,Class 0
"originally i wanted to be a computer scientist coder and learn how to hack, but after realizing that coding wasnt for me i drifted apart from that idea because it ended up not working for me.",Class 0
the other reason i am here is because it's a requirement but i don't see it like that way.,Class 0
im hoping that sci will help me to get started on complex problems which sometimes can scare me from the beginning.,Class 0
conceptual physics was a bit of a breeze but this semesters class is turning out to be anything but that.,Class 0
"so far, the engineering classes have been really enjoyable and tough.",Class 0
if i was capable of doing my work while in labor i have tons of reasons why i am here!,Class 0
physics can be confusing at times but i enjoy the math part of it for the most part.,Class 0
"however, i look forward to taking physics again at a college level and interested to see how it will go with an online setting instead of meeting facetoface.",Class 0
if i had the natural understanding i would not be here.,Class 0
having sci as a class with set times will really positively affect my learning and studying.,Class 0
"i lived in mexico for almost half my life and i know how bad the situation over there is, you cant really succeed and when the opportunity to move to the usa and have a better life came up it was something i couldnt say no to.",Class 0
"why am i here?i am here in this astronomy lab course because of my interest in space, the stars, planets and constellations.",Class 0
my purpose is for me to bring joy and happiness to those around me.,Class 0
"if i take it later, i might lose all my knowledge on the subject, whereas if i take it now, all my previous studying will be fresh in my head.",Class 0
"i took the job and as soon as i set foot on my first big construction site, i knew there was something there for me.",Class 0
i am a undergrad mechanical engineering student and i have to finish my phy classes to graduate.,Class 0
"the reason for that is because i have not taken physics at all, not even in highschool.",Class 0
"however, after working in the pharmaceutical setting, i came to realize that the work i was performing did not leave myself feeling satisfied but, instead, weary and tired.",Class 0
i should be able to apply what i learned from last semester into this class and maybe help some people out if they are stuck.,Class 0
"im basically here to further my education and to definitely learn something new, that i havent learned before.",Class 0
i am expecting to learn what physics is all about since i've never taken a physics course ever and hopefully i can utilize it in my everyday life so i'd be 'good to go' when i have my job after i graduate.,Class 0
anyways i have mark andrews at tight end should be a great year for him.,Class 0
"in the end, i decided to make sf state my home because i wanted to get away from home yet still be in the vicinity.",Class 0
i am here because i have to take this class.,Class 0
"putting this all together, i am here because i thought sci would be a great way to help me fully understand physics.",Class 0
i look forward to a great semester.,Class 0
"the first year was pretty hard, and i was always thinking i was so inferior.",Class 0
personally i think living here was way easier than it is now as rent is super high and the cost of living has drastically increased.,Class 0

going to class can be more clear than just reading from a book because you have explanations to help you.,Class 0
"though the requirements for being premed are simply a year of physics, a year of chem, and a year of bio, i realized that in college i want to delve deeper into these classes and not just do the minimum requirements.",Class 0
i have not had much experience with the subject of physics so i am hoping that this class will fulfill my expectations.,Class 0
"i then learned in the beginning of this semester that in order to take the lecture, you have to be in the lab at the same time.",Class 0

during this course i hope to learn about somethings i find interesting or may have heard of .,Class 0
"so far its been tough and sometimes, honestly, i dont wanna be here.",Class 0
"so to fully answer the question, ""why am i here"", i would have to say i am ultimately here to learn all of the information i need to know to take do successful on the mcat so that i can attend an amazing medical school so that one day i am able to become an inspiring female trauma surgeon.",Class 0
i used to hate physics at high school because the teacher was not passionate about teaching.,Class 0
i think is class will go hand and hand with my math class because so far we're learning about vectors.,Class 0
"however, i do believe there is a greater purpose to all things and the why is much deeper than simply getting a degree, stable job, and nice family.",Class 0
it is also fun to do physics expirements and do the math.,Class 0

"they do not judge if we get a question wrong, which is a major thing for me because it makes me feel more comfortable to actually ask questions.",Class 0
"i am studying earth sciences emphasizing in geology, and i have taken notice in some of the major chasses that physics is being applied in the way we express some of the systems of earth.",Class 0
"also, i am still very new to physics as i do not recall much from my previous physics class and was very bad at understanding how motion works in general.",Class 0
because it interests me.,Class 0

and for me to do that i have to make money.,Class 0
i've never taken a physics class before so most of this information is new to me but i find it very interesting.,Class 0
i am preparing myself in the best way possible by performing to the best of my abilities in all my courses.,Class 0
the big reason why i chose to come here was also how close it was to home seeing that i only live 20 to 20 minutes away.,Class 0
"however, i disagree with them on the idea where they say that a degree is useless.",Class 0
the whole idea of how the earth rotates around the sun psyches me out a little because how the hell did we really get here?,Class 0
the first and most important reason is because i needed 1 more unit to make full time status for my scholarships after i dropped my internship class.,Class 0

perhaps it's included to require students to round off their major with other subjectsso that students learn about subjects outside of their field.,Class 0
"it was also great with how the class itself interacted, were if there was anything someone comprehended really well they would try to explain it in another way that we werent told in lecture, or even by the instructors, so there was a variety of ways to break down the information for whomever needed it.",Class 0
"therefore, this class will give another chance to explore more about the subject.",Class 0
it's interesting to me and i've always seen electricity as a kind of magic because i really don't know how it gets into my power outlet and then into my toaster.,Class 0

"why am i here? there are multiple reasons as to why i am here, and i cant just say one while disregarding the others.",Class 0
since the major i wanted to do was game design but then i realized that computer science is what can help me get a better future.,Class 0
katya candray 1 september 2020 professor ghosh physics 112.02 reflective journaling 1 the reason that im here is because i believe that physics is an important subject to learn in order to help us think critically and also to get a basic understanding as to why and how the world works around us.,Class 0
"i am also here, enrolled in this sci class to help myself ask questions when i am not understanding a concept in physics.",Class 0

i am here because i was careless.,Class 0
"when i went to physical therapy, my therapist and i got really close during my process of rehabilitation.",Class 0
i look forward to getting refreshed on some of the material that will be discussed in class.,Class 0
"you know what, physics is dispensable to me because i dont study it and use it like those scientists.",Class 0
i am in this class due to it being a prereq for my major which is biology.,Class 0
"i wish i could understand the material better, and quicker for that matter, but honestly i will take what i can get at this point.",Class 0
also this semester is kind of different and its a bit challenging since you have to be on the computer and jump into different class and find links for zoom if you don't have the class added.,Class 0
i am here now to teach my daughter the right and wrong as she gets older.,Class 0
i am in this physics lab or this university to achieve higher education.,Class 0

i am interested to know exactly why things work the way they do.,Class 0
"also, i think physics is just generally interesting and i like to know how the world works and to be able to explain everyday concepts accurately.",Class 0
physics is a completely new topic for me as i have never taken classes related to this.,Class 0
the field seemed interesting in high school when i took my first programming class and the pay for new programmers seemed pretty good.,Class 0
this is my last semester of physics so after that i will hopefully never have to do it again.,Class 0
i am here in this course because it is going to make me a more successful student and aid my learning.,Class 0
what is all of our purpose?,Class 0
"to that my expectations are high, wish me luck.",Class 0
"however, now i realize that it is important supplemental material for my future in the medical industry.",Class 0
for example the force of that object or the speed of that ball i would know that i had seen that in physics.,Class 0
i am in this class because it is part of my required courses.,Class 0
i am taking physics 240 because it is necessary for my major which is electrical engineering.,Class 0
"the sci course also helps improve my gpa and gives me an extra unit, so it doesn't hurt to take it.",Class 0
"however, taking it in college has allowed me to understand it better than i did in high school.",Class 0
"furthermore, i get to learn and work with likeminded individuals who have similar goals.",Class 0
this can also help as a place where i can make connections to later be able to get into jobs or even just help each other out.,Class 0
"i have been doing this ever since i was young; building, creating, and mapping out ideas of invention models on paper.",Class 0
i think sci is a really good program because they are up to date what teachers are teaching in lecture and continue reviewing those topics.,Class 0
i am also in this specific sciclass because one of my friends is in this same class.,Class 0
i am taking not only one but two sci courses this semester.,Class 0
"since this is a broad paper about why we are here, i'm not sure if were supposed to be talking about here as in physics lab or here as in what our purpose in this world is.",Class 0
"street racing, or circuit racing.....",Class 0
i don't quit when there's harder problems.,Class 0
i ended up dropping a class that was during this class so that i could get help for bio 230 instead of trying to teach myself the information.,Class 0
i started questioning things around me and i just feel like we're in a simulation.,Class 0
"these are variations in perspective, ranging between scientific to philosophic.",Class 0
i chose to be in this course since it allows me to be a step closer to what i want to do or become in the future.,Class 0
i also really enjoyed physics last semester and knew that i would enjoy this class as well.,Class 0
"my whole life i was convinced that im bad at math, but im so stubborn that i kind of just decided that im gonna do it whether or not im good at it, because i enjoy it.",Class 0
the physics course was an overall good experience as well as i remember a lot of problems that were solved with the professor doing presentations.,Class 0
this course fulfills my physics class requirements and teaches me how to apply methods of using computerinterfaced measurement hardware to programs.,Class 0
(31) i have taken the lecture class physics 111 the semester before summer classes.,Class 0

which is interesting since i did all the history ap classes that my school had available as well as ap chemistry and ap biology.,Class 0
in this class i wish to experiment on cool stuff which can make me better understand the classroom physics.,Class 0
everyones purpose is different.,Class 0
you just have to want to do it.,Class 0

i need flexible hours.,Class 0
i had to take advantage of the chance of getting an education.,Class 0
physics has a lot to do with why the earth works the way it does and why certain natural things happen.,Class 0
"when i initially think of ""why am i here?"" i initially think it is just to fulfill a major requirement.",Class 0
"although, i took physics a couple years ago so i would need a refresher on some of the material.",Class 0
since i already have the credits of a junior ill graduate as a super senior or sadly.,Class 0
maybe i might even use this skill in the future.,Class 0
i enjoy the chemistry sci classes because they provide extra help and help me make study groups.,Class 0
im not smart enough.,Class 0
im thinking high ceilings at least 10 feet and so much air conditioning you need a jacket.,Class 0
it's within my understanding that this is similar to physics.,Class 0
this is something i must complete before moving forwards with it.,Class 0
a class specifically for studying and really understanding the concepts that are being thrown at us is exactly what i need because if im going to make it through as a biology major i need to learn everything for comprehension and not just for memorization.,Class 0
i am also here to learn about the meaning of life and how things around us work.,Class 0
there is other ways but i don't know anything about like starting my own business and i don't personally have the capital or credit to be able to venture out on my own so an education will eventually facilitate that.,Class 0
"in conclusion, the more knowledge the better.",Class 0
as the world transitions to more automation there is going to be more jobs that require the skills that i am currently learning.,Class 0
i am taking these courses in order to graduate and receive a college degree.,Class 0
i am taking this sci class to give myself more practice so ill be more prepared for exams and the material in general in class.,Class 0

i just need twentythree more wordseighteen now.,Class 0
"in the original physics section i had, this was not the case.",Class 0
one of the most interesting versions i've heard was that we were all angels that lost our ways and we are living many lives in order to fix the mistakes that weve made and in the different life times that we live we are learning different lessons and once we've learned all our lessons that's when we can finally fully rest.,Class 0
"this means that i cannot waste my life and have to live my life to the fullest, whether that be doing something that i love for the rest of my life or just experiencing new things and having fun in general.",Class 0
"i was able to handle the course work during middle and high school, and the subject matter made was more practical and made more sense to me than other subjects.",Class 0
i do not want to lie and say that this is not also my goal.,Class 0
things kinda suck but itll pass i guess.,Class 0
i wanted to experience a new environment and a new schooling system.,Class 0
"i am sitting here, in this building, at this school because it is what is expected of me and i am okay with that.",Class 0
i am here because i put it off to the last second.,Class 0
"but then for so long i struggled with school, with wanting to finish school etc.",Class 0
i cant understand the subject even though its the beginning of the semester.,Class 0
i wanted to get comfortable before pushing myself with how much work i was able to handle.,Class 0
i never thought about this question before or how i am suppose to answer.,Class 0
"the reason why i am in the physics lab is because the lecture itself cannot be done without a lab, and vice versa.",Class 0
"so, knowing from past sci classes, i knew that i needed to add this class to make sure that i dont fall behind and end up getting a bad grade.",Class 0
"i am here because out of all the schools i applied to ( i applied to about 4 schools) this was the school that i got accepted to, and i can say that coming up here has changed my perspective of so many things, i've learned so much more than what i would have learned staying in my home area.",Class 0
"last semester, about the time when math 199 class was almost ending, i heard that the next step, physics 111, would be much more tough than the current class.",Class 0
i am at san francisco state university because it is at home.,Class 0
"after i have taken the pervious physics classes, i feel now the labs are not that awful as i would expect.",Class 0
although i really don't like physics but i do enjoy doing experiments in labs and better understand the material.,Class 0
i am experiencing things here that i would have never learned about myself in socal.,Class 0
another reason i am here is to develop critical thinking and problem solving skills used when solving a problem.,Class 0
i am taking physics 111 because it fulfills my requirement for general education.,Class 0
"sci usually gives me tips, tricks, and a lot of practice for what i need to know to succeed.",Class 0

i also want to graduate early to save money speaking of which i just remembered i have a lot of scholarships i need to apply for.,Class 0
i knew that i was pretty bad with science as a subject since i was little.,Class 0
i think its vital to feel a class interesting.,Class 0
"in astronomy, you get to learn more about constellations and also makes you question things that you never thought about.",Class 0
i am here for a list of reasons.,Class 0
i do not expect myself to know everything but i know that i do have my resources and instructors who can help me.,Class 0
one common example of how physics is relevant to us is how cars move.,Class 0
"the alternatives to being a scientist were to be a nurse, doctor, or a bit of a disappointment.",Class 0
"i am here because of my friends, whom gave me confidence, happiness, and love.",Class 0
i don't know if this question is pertaining to why am i here at san francisco state university or why am i here in this class.,Class 0
"from there on, i plan to gain work experience, and live on my own off of my future career.",Class 0
i've never been a big fan of physics as a student and especially when i had taken ap physics in high school.,Class 0
ive wanted to learn more for physics and i am hoping its interesting like chem class.,Class 0
"i know i cant singlehandedly solve anything, change only happens if we all contribute to it so id rather try and be a contributor rather than not.",Class 0
"from xray, ct scans, and mri, all came from an understanding of physics and how electromagnetic fields work and such.",Class 0
my purpose is change and enlightenment.,Class 0
"the amount that is left to discover in our oceans excites me, just to be apart of those discoveries.",Class 0
this class is also probably a prereq for another class that i will need to take.,Class 0
i attend sf state because out of the many schools i applied to it was either here or csu eastbay and sf state didn't seem too bad in comparison.,Class 0
"i hope that by the end of this semester that i can get a better grade than without the sci classes help, and be able to go into physics 2 with confidence and the knowledge needed to do well there as well.",Class 0
i have no idea to be honest .,Class 0
"i am a transfer student, and my major is marine biology.",Class 0
i decided to drop this class last semester so that i could just focus on chemistry and pass the chemistry class.,Class 0
again i hope this works out.,Class 0
"with all that being said, i actually enjoy this class (lecture) so far because of the instructor.",Class 0
"if its possible, i might choose astronomy as my minor major in sfsu. im here to learn more things that i havent know about astronomy, so i can decide should i choose astronomy as my minor major.",Class 0
"but people fresh out of high school generally don't have the right mindset to get good software engineering work done, that's why degrees take 3 (or 4) years.",Class 0
"san francisco just happened to be one of the cheapest options for me at the time because going to college can be very expensive, but i would not have changed my whole experience for the world.",Class 0
"i think there is something planned for me, for all of us as to why we are here.",Class 0
i gain from working with peers and i love teaching others and seeing their eyes light up with understanding.,Class 0
"i know i still feel like i'm at the bottom sometimes, but i've taken the first intuitive into being able to accomplish that goal.",Class 0
that's why i'm here.,Class 0
but not in stereotypical ways.,Class 0
"ive lived near a city, los angeles to be exact, and sometimes i regret not staying in southern california to pursue my career.",Class 0
"for this reason, i plan to take all the prerequisites for med school.",Class 0
i hopefully will figure out more of my purpose at sf state the longer i'm here.,Class 0
other than the fact that most people are expected to go to college in their families i think that there could be other reasons as to why people go to college and that is because college is a brainstorming environment.,Class 0
some people i know recommend taking them separately to pace myself.,Class 0
"despite being a science major, i do not have a natural proclivity for the parent class.",Class 0
this scared me a little but i knew coming to college was the choice i had to make to get into my career.,Class 0
"its specially difficult to affirm oneself during this period we are experiencing because of the whole virus situation, but the one thing that i have learned from learning in this new format is how important resilience is.",Class 0
another reason i chose to go to sf state is because i love the cold weather.,Class 0
"going to college is an amazing experience not only for learning but to make connections, friends, and making memories.",Class 0
because of these reasons i decided to take sci 111 class during this semester.,Class 0
"but i need to pass this class in order to graduate, so i will have to do my best and give my all.",Class 0
"also, its at night so instead of wasting that time in doing nothing i now have something to do.",Class 0
"in reality, i always come back to the same thing, the reason i am here is to learn.",Class 0
i honestly don't know how this course will help me for my future goals or careers.,Class 0
in the end i would want to leave a legacy so my kids know that i did my work on this planet and to influence them to want to leave their mark.,Class 0
i'm here to make myself content as i can be and to travel.,Class 0
we have different thoughts and opinions on things which is why we crash too much so when we take turns with her we go by what we were taught.,Class 0
another main reason why i need the knowledge from this class is in order to take the mcat i need physics in my academic background.,Class 0
"lastly, i hope i am able to learned from the labs and have the professor help the entire class throughout the lab as a whole group.",Class 0
"as far as physics, i am somewhat familiar with basic material since i took this course in high school.",Class 0
it also shows me that we are all struggling with something.,Class 0
"i would like to do well in the course and i have heard that the supplemental instruction courses are very helpful and that students who take these courses, on average, do better in the actual class in comparison to students who dont take the sci course.",Class 0
those are some of the reasons on why i am here and why i am enrolled in taking the physics 102 lab.,Class 0
i actually dont exactly know why i am here.,Class 0
its pretty mellow here and theres a bunch of educated hipsters who attend this university.,Class 0
i knew that i need help for this class because what i am studying is new for me.,Class 0
and because i came into existence on the only known planet to support life.,Class 0
i feel like i often ask myself this question but lets see.,Class 0
i am here because last semesters sci course was extremely beneficial to me.,Class 0
"since science is with us everyday in life, and we could discovered them based on different principle.",Class 0
you can just work hard and succeed.,Class 0
it will also be interesting to see if i use physics in the medical profession in some way or another.,Class 0
regardless of that i hope this semester is way different and changes my perspective on physics.,Class 0
i would also like to help those in need of medical attention and help them to live a nice healthy life.,Class 0
i want to learn new things that i never knew before.,Class 0
"i am not pursuing this career just for the money, i also love learning about the human body, i find it very interesting.",Class 0
"if the labs were a little clearer, i feel like i would enjoy coming to class more too.",Class 0
i only had 10 or so credits so i needed one more class.,Class 0
i am here because i am majoring in biology.,Class 0
calculus 2 is a required course to major in mechanical engineering and failing calculus 2 will severely impact my college road map.,Class 0

i desire to begin to grasp the the balance of matter...,Class 0
even though this class is a requirement and i must complete it for my major i do not look at it that way.,Class 0
experiments carried out in physics laboratories helps students in learning how to be patient and attentive while using observation and before calculating the result.,Class 0
"i am here in this class because my major requires it, as well as phys 2, i hope to enjoy the things we will learn here.",Class 0
i felt very isolated in that school and felt like there were not enough programs to get involved in.,Class 0
i think that i need to learn how to self facilitate extra time to study and review in.,Class 0
im using my time wisely and getting rid of the classes that i can take here that transfer over.,Class 0
yes they did encourage and force me to choose my major but i do find interest in it.,Class 0
and i don't think anyone actually knows a definite answer considering there is no actual difference between me and the next person we are still on this same planet.,Class 0
i dont want to just get by my class i want to learn and apply the things i have learned to the world.,Class 0
"since i was planning on being an astrophysics major astronomy is not that far off from that in my opinion, so im perfectly fine with it.",Class 0
that was my favorite thing to do back home in the sunny weather because its too gloomy and cold up here.,Class 0
i enrolled in physics 112 laboratory because i wanted to be able to take it the same time as my physics 111 lecture.,Class 0
in which i can learn from them as well from their tactics.,Class 0
i often think that i dont need to live up to everyones expectations and i can just do what i want and live on.,Class 0
i've come here to become someone who knows what he's doing.the majority of my time as a student has been characterized by a lack of motivation to be proactive in my studies.,Class 0
i hope to learn many things from you and convert everything that i do learn into my every day life.,Class 0
so because of that i am very new to physics all i know about physics is that a lot of it has to do with math which i am somewhat comfortable with and i know there are formulas that i will need to understand what they do and how to apply them to a problem.,Class 0
"in this present moment, i am building myself up through education and experiences so that later in my life, i will be able to contribute to the personal growth of others and help them through their endeavours.",Class 0
i have always had a passion for hands on work and an affinity for math and physics.,Class 0
and also potluck!!,Class 0
i didn't realize this until i got my feet wet with sci for chem 115.,Class 0
i focus more on the human body and life.,Class 0
the reason i am here is because i am continuing my path as a biology major.,Class 0
i am here for an endless amount of reasons.,Class 0
i am currently a pre bio major planning to concentrate in physiology.,Class 0
in order to be able to invent anything i know i need to understand the physics behind it.,Class 0
"god put everyone on this earth to live freely, but with a purpose.",Class 0
"however, i know i cant continue to tech forever.",Class 0
also all the other sections for this class i have conflicts so it wouldn't work out.,Class 0
i am here because i have failed my second semester of physics because i didnt learn anything.,Class 0
i have no idea what i'm going to be doing after this but for now i'm here feeling like i'm doing something productive.,Class 0
i have several cousins that have a ba but that is all.,Class 0
"now that i think about it, learning is pretty fun and i don't want to stop learning forever.",Class 0
i hope i can make it through so i can fulfill this dream.,Class 0
she saw it as a massive waste of my time and future were i to pursue it further.,Class 0
the teachers this year in both my classes seem to be very enthusiastic which will further my learning experience.,Class 0
"people might say it is prerequisite to situs their major, and so on.",Class 0
for the reasons i listed above and for more that do not come to mind right now that is why i am here.,Class 0
