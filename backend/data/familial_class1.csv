"as a kid, i always wanted to go into an engineering field because i have family in it, but because of this reason i didnt initially pursue it."
"so, like many other students, i decided to follow my parents lead."
i had a lot in me and i obviously have my parents as mu role model since they finished college and got their degree.
i felt left out or more of left behind because i didnt know what i wanted to do or become even though my parents always had this path set for me as an engineer.
although i was surrounded around electrical and technology stuff because my dad has taught me and showed me about it so when applying for college i led to becoming an engineer major because it was what i was familiar with and something that interested me and had me going.
growing up i felt that it was expected of me by my friends and family to do well in school which wasn't an issue for me at all.
"when the news of this came to light to my family, i thought that i had disgraced them but in actuality they empathized with the hardships that i faced during school and were at least glad to have me back home."
i was raised by a hard working man who put his family over himself in every way possible.
since this was ingrained in my way of being at such a young age with my dad always working.
the work ethics that my dad has passed onto me has allowed me to overcome the tough times that both work and school throw at me.
the reason i am going to college and fully committing is because of my family.
my parents didnt have a college education and so they want to make sure that my siblings and i get one.
"at first i didnt want to go to college, i just wanted to work but the fact that my mom didnt allow me to leave school made me realize how important education is to them, and how it should be for us too."
my family has valued hard work.
"i have lived in the bay area my whole life and once rent started getting more and more expensive, my dad told me that its going to be hard to get a house when i am older."
my parents taught my brothers and i the values of working hard because to succeed in the bay area it is really expensive.
well one thing my mom has taught me is to not start something you cant finish or to finish what ive started.
"since i am the first one go to college in my family, my parents had sacrificed a lot to sent me to us to study, far away from the homeland."
"in general, im in school because i want to make my parents proud and break the generational cycle."
one of the main reasons why i am here is because i want to help my family.
i want to have the opportunity to have a stable job and be able to support my family economically.
i am also here because i want to have the opportunity to finish college something that my parents were not able to do it because they didnt have the money or the support.
i want to be the first one from my family to graduate from college.
"i am here at college because the career choices i want to take, require me to to get a degree in biology and also, more importantly, because my parents have sacrificed a lot to make it in this country as far as they could have and they would want me to be better off than they are."
also part of it is for my mom im only here because im just trying to make her proud and also make myself proud that i can get a degree.
hopefully im able to graduated in 4 years just because i do want to work for my master degree in the future i feel like its going to benefit me and especially for my mom and family.
"i am here before of my family; i want to make them proud showing them my accomplishments and being the best, i can."
i want to be able to support my parents and have a career.
most people wont want to take care of their parents but i believe i owe it to them to be as money motivated and goal striving as possible.
"since i can remember my family has always been in the construction business so whenever i look at structures, i imagine how they are built."
i am here because my mom took astronomy when she was in college and she loved it.
"i like to think im here because im meant to live a life that i, myself, find meaningful, and also because my parents wanted me to (haha)."
"at the moment, i want to be a therapist, although im not sure if i want to specialize with families or individuals, i do know i want to be there for people and be able to bring some relief to their lives."
i can think of many reasons my parent want me to be here and my moms family wants me to be here.
i would want to grow in my own career and never get lost in it and forget my roots nor family.
my dad is also a software engineer so i guess him working in the field has had some impact in my decision to do this as well.
"and although i was always inspired by the nature of my parents field, i never seemed to like their job."
"i come from an indian immigrant family, and all of my family members have worked hard to earn their places in the world."
"most of my family members are successful, and a majority of them are working in stem related careers."
my dad works in construction and i have been lucky to be able to work at the offices of were he worked.
"when i was still in high school, the question that what major should i study was always brought up by my parents, teachers, and even my schoolmates."
the reason why i want to go into the stem field is due to mainly my parents pushing it on to me.
"to be completely honest that's what i need for myself, my family and for my parents a good paying job that will help me repay them for everything they have helped me in and sacrifice to get me to be where i am right now, not to mention i want to giving them and myself a better life than what they lived when they were younger."
"""why do i want to go into the stem field?""when i was younger, the desire to go into the stem field was largely influenced by my parents and their dreams after immigrating here from bangladesh."
all throughout k12th grade i knew in my mind that i wanted to do stem as a way to try to accomplish one of my loving parents' dreams that they sacrificed so much for.
"i was later diagnosed with add, and to me it didn't feel any different knowing what i had or not, i still wanted to accomplish my parents dream no matter what it took.sadly, the idea that i had any sort of learning disability began to shatter my confidence in myself and my grades, my interest, and my dream all started to get out of reach."
"my dad, two aunts, and uncle are all civil engineers and i have been to work with all of them and visited project sites, so i knew i would enjoy what i'd be doing."
being able to get a good job in programming and making good money to repay my parents for all the help they have given me growing up is my reason for going into the stem field.
especially my parents who sacrificed a lot for my siblings and i to live a better life; it makes me want to push more to see them happy and hopefully give back to them for all they have done.
i am very grateful for the educational path i am taking as a first generation college student!
i have very supportive parents and family that have gotten me to this point.
"however, i do know that i am here because my parents expected me to succeed and thrive in the environment that america has to offer."
"their struggles meant that as the first born of a second generation immigrant family, i was expected to succeed in academics in order to help my parents and brother survive."
i want to be able to support myself financially and also give back to my parents and my friends who have been there for me through all the struggles and the hard times in my life.
san francisco state university has a special place in my heart and in my family.
when my dad was only 18 years old he traveled to the united states alone to attend san francisco state university in order to pursue a degree in engineering.
"my dad attended this school, all my uncles attended this school, and many of my siblings older than me have attended."
"i feel like there is a part of my familys history here at san francisco state university, and so i feel special that i am able to attend as well."
i am here because my parents wanted me to stay close since i grew up in sf and so they didn't want me going across the country to go to school.
"i am also here because my older brother goes here so i felt like my parents wanted me to follow in his footsteps, so i just chose the closest school around me."
since i was little my dad used to say that whatever you learn at school you should always use it to improve your everyday lives.
my parents are helping me pay tuition and i don't want them paying too much.
"of course, an important reason as to why i am here is because of everything my parents have done for me from all the guidance, sacrifices, affection, time, and so on that theyve given me till now."
"im an at sfsu because i come from a family that did not have the privilege of attending college, so i am doing it also on my familys behalf."
"i hope that one day when i graduate from college and become a vet, my family will be proud of me and know that i didnt only go it for my own benefit, but theirs as well."
"i also want to be able to give back to my family as much as possible, because they sacrificed so much to get me to where i am today."
"of course, if there's a deeper meaning then it is because i am a first generation college student for my family and seeing how hard they've worked to provide for me and my siblings, i definitely want to return the favor ten fold by earning a degree and getting a good pay jobing."
"i would also very much like to provide for my family once i get a job so they're not exhausted everyday and can enjoy the rest of their life relaxing or having fun because as the oldest daughter, i also had to play the role of being a parent towards my siblings when they faced hardships."
my parents own a small business and they always help people out when they cant afford it.
im inspired by my parents and i hope to make a bigger positive impact in other strangers' lives.
"i don't want to struggle like my mom did, and im hoping to re pay her back for everything that shes done for me."
but my mom raised me and my sister.
also i was given the opportunity to be the first one in college and prove my family wrong that even though i was raised by a single parent i still made it to college.
"i am her leader as well as her dad even though her father is from another background (im mexican, his salvadorian)."
"i am here because i want to pursue a career that i enjoy doing, i may not know at the moment but that's what college is for, to figure myself out a bit more."
i am also here for my parents who had made a lot of sacrifices to get my siblings and i where we are at right now.
i want to be the first to graduate from college to make those sacrifices worth it but also to provide a good example to my siblings since i'm the oldest.
i want to do what makes me happy while making my parents proud and i would like to give them back for all those years that weren't easy and to show them how much i appreciate them for everything.
"""why am i here?"" i am here at sfsu making my family proud as i am the first in both sides of my family to go to college."
i am here as i am now setting an example fro my younger family members as they will now have someone to look up to.
"i am here as i will be graduating in just a few months and all my family members will be able to see me graduate, virtually or on stage."
"i am here for not only myself, but to make my parents proud as they sacrificed so much for me as i was growing up."
i am here to make a difference in my family's life.
the reason i want to be a dentist is because my family is oral surgeon and when i graduate everything is going to be ready for me.
at a very young age my parents taught me the importance of knowledge and good education.
"since i am a first generation american, my parents believed that with a good education, my sister and i could have a better life and more opportunities."
this is in order to find new and more effective medicines to help people like my mom who suffering from chronic illnesses.
my parents immigrated to this country 30 years ago and instilled that education was the way to success.
"on a more personal level, i believe i am here to make my parents and family proud, along with being a good example towards my younger siblings."
"as the oldest in my family and also the first to go to college, i am here to show my parents that their sacrifices are not going to waste."
id answer by saying i am a first generation college student who has alway loved school and who has dreamt of going to college since i was a little girl.
"i am going to college so that i can get a higher better paying job, and escape having to live paycheck to paycheck, and many other hardships that my parents had to face while i was growing up."
"i am here because my parents migrated to the united states in order to provide a better life to their future family, which would be my siblings and i. my parents wanted to give their children the opportunity to go to college, an opportunity that is unfortunately not granted to many of my family members back in mexico."
sfsu is also a college that is relatively close to where i live so i chose to go here in order to be able to stay with my family which is important to me.
"when i am around my family and loved ones, it refocuses me and refreshes me."
"if we go on a personal level, i would also like to support my family with what i decide to do because the one sole reason my parents are here is to support me and i wanted to do the same for them to show their efforts have not gone wasted."
louie jackson932020physics112jonathan weisbaumwhy am i here?i am here because i want to honor the sacrifices that both my parents had to take in order for me to get an education here in the united states.
"so, i am here because i was pushed by my family to pursue a higher education, an education they never had."
if we are speaking more broadly though im here because of my family pushing me to do better and to make sure that im able to provide for myself.
"during this quarterlife crisis, my mom suggested that i look into a career as a mechanical engineer which i promptly laughed off and dismissed."
"although i had great friends at uofa (and im still friends with them today, i have since visited the school since i transferred out), i felt so far away from my parents and felt very constricted to staying in just that one area of arizona, since i didnt have a car and things offcampus werent easily accessible."
"at that point, i decided that i wanted to transfer schools back to california, where my parents were, so i could be closer to home."
i am here because of my mom's courage and i look forward to embrace her courage and bravery of coming to this country.
"i am a first generation student, and the oldest of my siblings."
"i want to be a role model for my siblings, so they can have someone to rely upon."
"hearing my moms history, and seeing that she didnt have the opportunity to go to college is what motivates me to be here where i am now."
"as a younger girl my mom had to work, and help out in the house, making it harder to finish her education."
"in addition, in order to succeed and become my career i have to first get a bachelor in biology, and i would get it by graduating from sfsu. lastly, i am here to be able to help my family out, and support them economically."
"i am in this physics class because physics is required for my major, but my dad loves physics and encouraged me to take physics with calculus instead of the physics course that does not incorporate calculus."
im here because education is important in my family.
"my parents couldnt obtain their education because they had other priorities but they made sure to work hard and guarantee that their kids will have the opportunity, the choice, to obtain their education."
another reason why i am here is for my family.
my family has always stood behind me after so many hings have happened.
"the campus is also very close to my house so i can live offcampus and stay closer to my family, especially now that my grandfather requires inhome support."
"in my parents perspective im here to better my education and to gain a well paid career and profession, in their eyes im here to make them proud and to be their successor of sorts......for me on the other hand im here to try to persue my dreams of working with exotic animals that i had as a child but to be completely honest now that im here working towards my degree and career path i feel lost, some days i wake up with a good mind set and ""get it done"" mind set but as the day continues with classes and school i get defeated and i'm not sure if its because i get overwhelmed with school and the material of my classes or if it is just me overthinking and overreacting over my responsibilities that my classes give me as well as just trying to live in society, handling two jobs, a relationship, bills....lots of bills, and money."
somedays i feel like my reason for being here at school specifically is blurred from me....other days i feel like the reason for me being here is based on the expectations of other people especially my parents and family and people who look up to me and who believe in me and depend on me to make something out of myself.
"money is hard to come by for me, i dont have a job and im chewing away from my familys money, i feel guilty every time i ask from them."
i am here at san francisco state university as an undergrad student because it was always a dream for me to go to a 4 year college right after high school and because education is really important to me due to what my parents have instilled in me as a child which is that knowledge is power.
"why am i here in general i would say to pursue a career in medicine, i am a first generation college student and i want to make my family proud and let them know that their struggles were not for nothing."
with the advantage i am at with the support of my family i intend to provide care and give medical relief to those without access to the care and resources everyone deserves.
i'm here for myself and most importantly my parents.
my parents always enforced me to go to school to have a better future because they always remind me that they are immigrants and they did not have the same opportunities that i do in this country so i have to take advantage of that.
i am here to give my parents in return everything they ever did for me.
"i am here because of my family; they brought me up, and went through numerous obstacles for me to have a better future."
"i am a first generation student, and the oldest of my siblings."
"i want to be a role model for my siblings, so they can have someone to rely upon."

i want to my parents to be proud of me and know that their sacrifices didn't go to waste.
i am here to set a good example for my siblings because i love them and i want the best for them.
to not struggle as much with other things like my parents because i know they also want my life to be like that.
my parents have pushed me to go into college and so that was my goal.
i am here because i want to further advance my education and be the first in my family to graduate college.
my family continually inspires me to be a better person and to give back to the community that raised me.
"i am here because of my parents, i wouldn't have graduated in a 4year university if it wasn't for my parents, i originally wanted to start off in community college but now i'm glad that i got that little push to be able to say i graduated in collage 4 years straight out of high school and now able to get a career."
i am here because i am getting my degree and i know by doing this i am making myself proud and i am also making my family proud.
"i am here because i want to have a decent life when i grow up and do what my parents wanted me to do, get a high education so i won't have to struggle financially just like they did."
i am here because i am a first generation student and i want to make my parents proud.
i am very lucky to be in such an amazing school and that my parents are able to help me and support me every step of the way.
my sister wasnt able to go to a four year so for my family me being in a four year school is amazing and the fact that im the first from my family is amazing and i dont want to let them down.
i am in san francisco because i have always been close with my parents and i wouldnt know what to do if i were to go somewhere far away from home.
"although it does build independence, my parents are the main reason i am the way i am, and for that i am thankful."
"moreover, i am a college student because i am the first in my family to go, and i want to have a better life than the one my parents are currently living."
"during my time there, i started to get more involved with the many biology departments which allow me to set up mentorships with the researchers to develop a love for biology because i have an interest in learning how biology works for the creation of all things that are living on the planet.another reason why i am here is that i would the first in my family to be able to go to college and pursue a degree in biology."
i have two sisters and i love my family; my parents are the main reason im in college because i want to support them in the future and provide for them like they did with me.
one of my motivations for doing well is probably my parents and wanting to make them proud.
"for the rpt, i think it might be fun to do your job depending on your passion as well, but also there are a few wellpaying jobs and i want to be able to provide for my family, i found this out from one of my professors i had for rpt. the researching in biology is awesome, for me i thought the environment conservation one is interesting."
this somtimes tends to bring me down being a zoology major had always been a dream of mine and i just want to be able to accomplish that goal and make not only myself but my family proud of everything they have sacrificed for me since i wasn't able to get fafsa to help me achieve my goal and pay for half of my schooling.
"i am also here for my parents because they have helped me throughout my short college career and i want to make them feel proud of me, they already are since i am here in sfsu but i want to make them feel like all their sacrifices are worth it."
"i want to set an example for my siblings, i want them to do better than what i am doing, i want them to achieve way more than what i had."
i am here so that i can make my mom proud and be one of the first people in my family to complete college and get a degree; because making them happy android means a lot to me.
"being here in college and in physics is extremely important to me because without being here i wouldnt be able to purse and execute my goals or make my family proud, being here makes me who i am."
"i am a first generation student, and the oldest of my siblings."
"i want to be a role model for my siblings, so they can have someone to rely upon."
"hearing my moms history, and seeing that she didnt have the opportunity to go to college is what motivates me to be here where i am now."
"as a younger girl my mom had to work, and help out in the house, making it harder to finish her education."
"in addition, in order to succeed and become my career i have to first get a bachelor in biology, and i would get it by graduating from sfsu. lastly, i am here to be able to help my family out, and support them economically."
this is why i want to be able to get a good stable job to be able to support my family since they're getting old.
my parents have sacrificed so much to get me to where i am today.
"i am here to also show to my family, friends, and other latinx women that it is possible to do this and to pursue a career in a stem major."
my mom has been the biggest influence in helping me make my decisions.
why am i here?my family has been my main influence.
i always knew i wanted to be a doctor but seeing how bad the system is in mexico and how my family over there was dying because of doctors who didnt know what to do is when i really wanted to become one because i wanted to be the change i want to be able to help save lives and not end lives.
i am here however not solely by my own merit but my family's as well.
i also want to really make my family happy with being able to become a doctor.
i want to be able to pay my family back for all they have done for me so far.
"also by pushing myself through all this, when i have a family i could be a great example to my children."
i am also here for my parents who never got to finish college themselves.
i wouldnt be here without my parents who sacrificed a lot for me to be here.
i am part of the first generation in my family to go to college and hopefully get a degree and i am trying to make my parents proud but also learn things for myself and get a career that will give me financial stability and also a career where i will help tons of people.
i am here because i want to be the first one of my family to graduate from college and make them proud.
"i want to be able to help and support my family, do the same for them what they have always done for me."
