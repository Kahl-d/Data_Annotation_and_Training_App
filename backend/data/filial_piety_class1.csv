"growing up, my parents always told me that college was not a choice but a requirement."
neither of my parents ever got to 7th grade so they have always pushed my siblings and i when it came to school.

they work so hard to support me and my siblings to send us all to college.
i am the first generation to go to college so i want to show my parents my love for science and become something.
despite what my grades may say.im here because my family wanted me to have a better life than they did back in china they gave up what amazing or bad opportunities they had all for my and my brothers futures.
im here because my parents didnt bring me here for for me not to take advantages of all the opportunities that i have here.
i am a very family orientated person so i just want to make everyone happy and proud of me .
im here because of all the sacrifices that both my parents have made for me and my little sisters.
im here to disapprove stereotypes im here for a better future for myself im here for my family and everything they have given up for me to be here.
i am here because i want to make my mom proud.
i am here because my parents want me to finish college.
i am fine with my parents wanting me to go through college even though there have been a lot of struggles with my time here because i feel like i have grown as a person and met a lot of people i have gotten really close to through just being involved at school.
the reason i am going to college and fully committing is because of my family.
my parents didnt have a college education and so they want to make sure that my siblings and i get one.
"at first i didnt want to go to college, i just wanted to work but the fact that my mom didnt allow me to leave school made me realize how important education is to them, and how it should be for us too."
"i have lived in the bay area my whole life and once rent started getting more and more expensive, my dad told me that its going to be hard to get a house when i am older."
my parents taught my brothers and i the values of working hard because to succeed in the bay area it is really expensive.
"since i am the first one go to college in my family, my parents had sacrificed a lot to sent me to us to study, far away from the homeland."
"in general, im in school because i want to make my parents proud and break the generational cycle."
one of the main reasons why i am here is because i want to help my family.
i want to have the opportunity to have a stable job and be able to support my family economically.
i am also here because i want to have the opportunity to finish college something that my parents were not able to do it because they didnt have the money or the support.
i want to be the first one from my family to graduate from college.
"i am here at college because the career choices i want to take, require me to to get a degree in biology and also, more importantly, because my parents have sacrificed a lot to make it in this country as far as they could have and they would want me to be better off than they are."
also part of it is for my mom im only here because im just trying to make her proud and also make myself proud that i can get a degree.
hopefully im able to graduated in 4 years just because i do want to work for my master degree in the future i feel like its going to benefit me and especially for my mom and family.
"i am here before of my family; i want to make them proud showing them my accomplishments and being the best, i can."
i want to be able to support my parents and have a career.
most people wont want to take care of their parents but i believe i owe it to them to be as money motivated and goal striving as possible.
"as a first generation college student, my passing through college is not only for me, but for my family as well."
i believe that i am here to help others since i have always grown up taking care of my grandparents and siblings.
"i believe that i am here to also make my parents proud and most importantly, to make myself proud."
"i also want to have a family in the future and be able to take care and provide for them, so i want to have a good job that will help me become financially stable in the near future."
"for example, i knew the roles i would have to take on when my little sister came into the world; i needed and wanted to be a good role model for her so she can come to me with whatever problems she is going through."
"i like to think im here because im meant to live a life that i, myself, find meaningful, and also because my parents wanted me to (haha)."
"at the moment, i want to be a therapist, although im not sure if i want to specialize with families or individuals, i do know i want to be there for people and be able to bring some relief to their lives."
i can think of many reasons my parent want me to be here and my moms family wants me to be here.
i would want to grow in my own career and never get lost in it and forget my roots nor family.
"i come from an indian immigrant family, and all of my family members have worked hard to earn their places in the world."
"most of my family members are successful, and a majority of them are working in stem related careers."
the reason why i want to go into the stem field is due to mainly my parents pushing it on to me.
"to be completely honest that's what i need for myself, my family and for my parents a good paying job that will help me repay them for everything they have helped me in and sacrifice to get me to be where i am right now, not to mention i want to giving them and myself a better life than what they lived when they were younger."
"""why do i want to go into the stem field?""when i was younger, the desire to go into the stem field was largely influenced by my parents and their dreams after immigrating here from bangladesh."
all throughout k12th grade i knew in my mind that i wanted to do stem as a way to try to accomplish one of my loving parents' dreams that they sacrificed so much for.
"i was later diagnosed with add, and to me it didn't feel any different knowing what i had or not, i still wanted to accomplish my parents dream no matter what it took.sadly, the idea that i had any sort of learning disability began to shatter my confidence in myself and my grades, my interest, and my dream all started to get out of reach."
"yes, i am here, getting a degree because that's what my family and society expects of me and i know it's something i have to do, but there is so much more life than a career and academics."
being able to get a good job in programming and making good money to repay my parents for all the help they have given me growing up is my reason for going into the stem field.
especially my parents who sacrificed a lot for my siblings and i to live a better life; it makes me want to push more to see them happy and hopefully give back to them for all they have done.
i am very grateful for the educational path i am taking as a first generation college student!
"in terms of why i'm at college, it's because it's difficult to start a decent career without at least one degree and i want to be able to provide for myself and my future family as adequately as i'm able."
"however, i do know that i am here because my parents expected me to succeed and thrive in the environment that america has to offer."
"their struggles meant that as the first born of a second generation immigrant family, i was expected to succeed in academics in order to help my parents and brother survive."
i want to be able to support myself financially and also give back to my parents and my friends who have been there for me through all the struggles and the hard times in my life.
"i'm passionate about the field and i want to use the opportunity to help those that are less fortunate and at the same time, help support my family."
i am here because my parents wanted me to stay close since i grew up in sf and so they didn't want me going across the country to go to school.
"i am also here because my older brother goes here so i felt like my parents wanted me to follow in his footsteps, so i just chose the closest school around me."
if i had to guess why i'm here it would be because my mom needed me to be here.
"they want a gift or a blessing or just help and i think for my family and specifically, my mom that is me."
"and now, as my mom gets older i look after my sister who really needs me maybe i'm just here to look out for her the whole time."
another benefit of completing this goal is making my family proud and inviting them to do anything they want because i will have enough money.
"im an at sfsu because i come from a family that did not have the privilege of attending college, so i am doing it also on my familys behalf."
"i hope that one day when i graduate from college and become a vet, my family will be proud of me and know that i didnt only go it for my own benefit, but theirs as well."
"i also want to be able to give back to my family as much as possible, because they sacrificed so much to get me to where i am today."
"i want to be able to help my family, be able to graduate, find a good job in the future, etc."
"i want to be able to make my parents, family, and friends happy because of what i can do and show them that i can do it."
"of course, if there's a deeper meaning then it is because i am a first generation college student for my family and seeing how hard they've worked to provide for me and my siblings, i definitely want to return the favor ten fold by earning a degree and getting a good pay jobing."
"i would also very much like to provide for my family once i get a job so they're not exhausted everyday and can enjoy the rest of their life relaxing or having fun because as the oldest daughter, i also had to play the role of being a parent towards my siblings when they faced hardships."
my parents own a small business and they always help people out when they cant afford it.
im inspired by my parents and i hope to make a bigger positive impact in other strangers' lives.
"i want to also be able to set up my family for success, i continue to put all this pressure on myself because i know i can achieve the goals i have for myself."
"i want to make my family, friends and community proud cause if this year has taught me anything is that a smile and positivity goes a long way."
"i don't want to struggle like my mom did, and im hoping to re pay her back for everything that shes done for me."
"but if i had to give an answer i would most likely say it is for my future and to make my parents proud of me for achieving a goal, especially within the science category."
i love that i can be independent and away from home that teaches me life lessons and not to rely on my parents for everything so it gives me a sense of responsibility and responsibility.
growing up i helped my mom care for herself as she battled cancer and helping seemed so natural to me.
my goal in life is to ensure i live a life my mom would be proud of.
i am also attending school because there is an expectation of me to go since i am a first generation.
i am here to help make a better life for my parents.
but my mom raised me and my sister.
also i was given the opportunity to be the first one in college and prove my family wrong that even though i was raised by a single parent i still made it to college.
"i am her leader as well as her dad even though her father is from another background (im mexican, his salvadorian)."
"i am here because i want to pursue a career that i enjoy doing, i may not know at the moment but that's what college is for, to figure myself out a bit more."
i am also here for my parents who had made a lot of sacrifices to get my siblings and i where we are at right now.
i want to be the first to graduate from college to make those sacrifices worth it but also to provide a good example to my siblings since i'm the oldest.
i want to do what makes me happy while making my parents proud and i would like to give them back for all those years that weren't easy and to show them how much i appreciate them for everything.
"""why am i here?"" i am here at sfsu making my family proud as i am the first in both sides of my family to go to college."
i am here as i am now setting an example fro my younger family members as they will now have someone to look up to.
"i am here as i will be graduating in just a few months and all my family members will be able to see me graduate, virtually or on stage."
"i am here for not only myself, but to make my parents proud as they sacrificed so much for me as i was growing up."
i am here to make a difference in my family's life.
im here because i want a better future for my family and i. i am here because i would be the first in my family to have attended and hope to graduate from college.
"overall, i want to make an impact in my community and be seen as a role model and i am here for a better future for my family and i."
this is in order to find new and more effective medicines to help people like my mom who suffering from chronic illnesses.
my parents immigrated to this country 30 years ago and instilled that education was the way to success.
"on a more personal level, i believe i am here to make my parents and family proud, along with being a good example towards my younger siblings."
"as the oldest in my family and also the first to go to college, i am here to show my parents that their sacrifices are not going to waste."
"because i want to be successful, i want to make my parents proud and most importantly i want to reach my full potential and make myself proud."
i want to be a good role model for my little brother and care for parents in the future.
i am here because of my family.
"i am the first to go to a university within the united states, i want to make them proud and support my family here, and peru."
i want to take advantage of this education and hopefully receive income to where i can support my family and doing it with something i love to do.
deep down i am doing this also for my mother and my family to have a better education that my family was unable to get.
i also want to be a role model for my 4 siblings and show them that college is an option and it can lead to many opportunities.
"before i was listening to my parents who told me that a science degree would not give me the amount of job opportunities later on in life, but now i have learned that if your whole heart is not in something, then it is not worth doing."
my dream is to become a lawyer and someday have the money o be able to provide for my family.
but looking at how i got here is something truly amazing as all the accidents and coincidences have led me to this moment.
"if we go on a personal level, i would also like to support my family with what i decide to do because the one sole reason my parents are here is to support me and i wanted to do the same for them to show their efforts have not gone wasted."
"why are you here?the reason why i am at sfsu is because i wanted to be the first in my family to go to college because my mom really wanted to see one of her children going to college and i was the last out of her 3 kids that has the chance to go because my older brothers didnt want to go to college, and i wanted to make her proud."
louie jackson932020physics112jonathan weisbaumwhy am i here?i am here because i want to honor the sacrifices that both my parents had to take in order for me to get an education here in the united states.
i am here so i can graduate and make my parents proud and never have to listen to them nag at me.
"i am a first generation student, and the oldest of my siblings."
"i want to be a role model for my siblings, so they can have someone to rely upon."
"hearing my moms history, and seeing that she didnt have the opportunity to go to college is what motivates me to be here where i am now."
"as a younger girl my mom had to work, and help out in the house, making it harder to finish her education."
"in addition, in order to succeed and become my career i have to first get a bachelor in biology, and i would get it by graduating from sfsu. lastly, i am here to be able to help my family out, and support them economically."
i am here to do what she didn't and prove to my family and friends i can go through a higher education.
im here because education is important in my family.
"my parents couldnt obtain their education because they had other priorities but they made sure to work hard and guarantee that their kids will have the opportunity, the choice, to obtain their education."
the reason why i want to become a computer engineer is so i can program games to make kids happy and to make my parents and myself financially stable.
another reason why i am here is for my family.
my family has always stood behind me after so many hings have happened.
"in my parents perspective im here to better my education and to gain a well paid career and profession, in their eyes im here to make them proud and to be their successor of sorts......for me on the other hand im here to try to persue my dreams of working with exotic animals that i had as a child but to be completely honest now that im here working towards my degree and career path i feel lost, some days i wake up with a good mind set and ""get it done"" mind set but as the day continues with classes and school i get defeated and i'm not sure if its because i get overwhelmed with school and the material of my classes or if it is just me overthinking and overreacting over my responsibilities that my classes give me as well as just trying to live in society, handling two jobs, a relationship, bills....lots of bills, and money."
somedays i feel like my reason for being here at school specifically is blurred from me....other days i feel like the reason for me being here is based on the expectations of other people especially my parents and family and people who look up to me and who believe in me and depend on me to make something out of myself.
"why am i here in general i would say to pursue a career in medicine, i am a first generation college student and i want to make my family proud and let them know that their struggles were not for nothing."
with the advantage i am at with the support of my family i intend to provide care and give medical relief to those without access to the care and resources everyone deserves.
i'm here for myself and most importantly my parents.
my parents always enforced me to go to school to have a better future because they always remind me that they are immigrants and they did not have the same opportunities that i do in this country so i have to take advantage of that.
i come from a family of 5 brothers and im the second oldest brother in the family so it's extremely stressful to evaluate every move that i make so that i could become a good role model to all my brother so that the path of obtaining a higher education could be possible through hard work and dedication.
i am here to give my parents in return everything they ever did for me.
i am the first out of my siblings to attend a university so i am really trying to make them and my parents proud and also learn more about myself and other perspectives while in university.
"i am here because i want to make my parents proud, and because they want me to be successful."
"i am a first generation student, and the oldest of my siblings."
"i want to be a role model for my siblings, so they can have someone to rely upon."
"hearing my moms history, and seeing that she didnt have the opportunity to go to college is what motivates me to be here where i am now."
"as a younger girl my mom had to work, and help out in the house, making it harder to finish her education."
