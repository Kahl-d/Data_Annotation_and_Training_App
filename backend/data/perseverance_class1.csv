it's also something very motivating for me to be a first generation in college and the first to be majoring as an engineer so that continues to push me to continue being in the stem field despite how challenging this field is.
"the short version of that story is that i grew up kind of poor, joined the military at 18 years old, used my va benefits to go school after i separated from active duty, went to art school for a few years, took a class where we learned to develop a mobile application by leveraging preexisting gui's, and that was the moment when i first got exposed to a little bit of stem. if you would have told high school me that i'd be 2 semesters away from graduating with a bs in electrical engineering, i would never have believed it, mostly because my grades were terrible, but also because i had no idea what stem was back then."
i know i got to work hard because if you put your heart into and work hard you can do anything.
like math is very difficult for other and it is for me too but i like the challenge i love the feeling like i solved it no matter how hard and long time it took me.
after a decade of working and being able to take one class here and one class there i joined the army as a medic and pushing through the exhaustion of working as a healthcare worker during the pandemic and taking an online class (which is super hard to do because i thrive on in class learning).
when i first took physics last fall semester i was so nervous because of the negative stigma towards this class and even the doubt many people have about women in stem. after taking the first part of general physics i was so excited to keep learning more about physics since it happens every second of our lives.
"i am also not the best in math, so after taking this class i want to accomplish my goals of doing good and be able to solve the problems without having any trouble and be confident in the work that i am doing."
even though this class might be hard for me because it is not in person i truly will work my hardest to do all the labs and try to understand each concept as well as work in groups through zoom.
"but, nonetheless i know its necessary for myself to try and push forward even with the situation as it's better to still learn than do nothing instead."
"i am also not the best in math, so after taking this class i want to accomplish my goals of doing good and be able to solve the problems without having any trouble and be confident in the work that i am doing, especially with calculations and working with graphscharts."
sometime i am frustrated with physics but then i remember i wouldn't be taking this class if i didn't need it to go where i'm going in life so i need to work hard and retain the most information i can.
i am excited to start this semester and overcome my challenges i face in this class.
although it is a little confusing as of now i have faith that it'll get easier through out the semester.

"this concept isnt easy for me to grasp and now since bio240 mostly feels like theoretical information and a lot of words, being here and studying with others taking the class will help me and motivate me to keep pursuing the task to be successful and will give me the motivation to get that passing grade."
last semester i barely passed bio 230 with a c and i want to be able to change that because i wasnt aware of a sci class and now that i am aware of the class i can meet new peers who can also help me and we can all each learn from one another because at the end of the day we each approach things differently so maybe some of the things they say would be better understood than in lecture.
"growing up, i had to overcome a lot of challenges in my life in order to get to where i am right now, and having that extra support definitely helps a lot when it comes to tackling these challenges."
"sure, itll be challenging, but with a but of help, i think ill be ok."

"i have a really hard time remembering the steps to doing certain problems and i have to look back on notes to be able to do them so, i hope with the extra support that i will be getting in the class will help me improve on remembering the steps and not have to refer back to my notes too much."
i am here because i know i struggle in chemistry classes and really want to do good in quantitative chemical analysis.
"i know this journey will not be easy, i but i am doing my best, studying hard, and trying to accomplish my goal."
school has always been hard for me but i'm determined to do well even though it's taking me a bit longer than everyone else.
"they taught me the value of hard work and perseverance, that not everything comes easily that failing is inevitable but you can always try again."
